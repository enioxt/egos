# CORUJA-MYCELIUM: Performance Metrics Implementation

## Task Description

Implement a comprehensive performance metrics collection and reporting system for the CORUJA-MYCELIUM integration to identify bottlenecks, track performance over time, and validate optimizations.

## Implementation Details

A robust performance metrics system has been implemented with the following features:

- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Latency tracking for operations with statistical analysis
  - Error counting by operation and error type
  - Request counting and throughput calculation
  - Circuit breaker state change tracking
  - Custom metrics for specialized measurements

- **Analysis Capabilities**:
  - Time-window based filtering (e.g., last hour, last day)
  - Statistical summaries (min, max, avg, median, percentiles)
  - Circuit breaker state transition analysis
  - Aggregated reporting across all metrics

- **Integration Methods**:
  - Decorator-based instrumentation for functions and methods
  - Both synchronous and asynchronous function support
  - Thread-safe implementation for concurrent environments
  - Minimal overhead design

## Technical Specifications

The implementation provides several key capabilities:

### 1. Core Metrics

- **Latency**: Tracks operation duration with detailed statistics
  - Calculation of min, max, avg, median, p90, p95, p99
  - Time-window filtering
  - Sample count limiting to prevent memory issues

- **Errors**: Tracks error occurrences by type
  - Categorized by operation and error type
  - Aggregated error statistics

- **Throughput**: Calculates operations per second
  - Based on request count over time
  - Time-window based calculation

- **Circuit Breaker Metrics**: Monitors resilience patterns
  - State transition tracking
  - Mean time between state changes
  - State distribution analysis

### 2. Instrumentation Patterns

Two decorator patterns have been implemented for ease of use:

```python
# For regular functions
@measure_latency("operation_name", metrics_instance)
def some_function():
    # Function is now instrumented
    
# For async functions
@measure_async_latency("operation_name", metrics_instance)
async def some_async_function():
    # Async function is now instrumented
```

### 3. Usage Example

```python
# Initialize metrics
metrics = PerformanceMetrics(max_samples=1000, history_window=3600)

# Record metrics manually
metrics.record_latency("send_request", 150.0)  # 150ms
metrics.record_error("parse_response", "ValueError")
metrics.record_request("get_data", count=5)
metrics.record_circuit_state_change("mycelium_publish", "open", "5 consecutive failures")

# Get statistics
latency_stats = metrics.get_latency_statistics("send_request", time_window=600)  # Last 10 minutes
error_stats = metrics.get_error_statistics()
throughput = metrics.get_throughput("get_data")
circuit_stats = metrics.get_circuit_breaker_statistics("mycelium_publish")

# Or get all statistics at once
all_stats = metrics.get_all_statistics(time_window=3600)  # Last hour
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite implemented to verify:

- Latency recording and statistics calculation
- Error tracking and reporting
- Throughput calculation accuracy
- Circuit breaker state monitoring
- Time-window based filtering
- Decorator functionality for both sync and async functions
- Thread safety
- Error handling within decorators

## Additional Notes

This implementation lays the groundwork for the performance optimization phase of the CORUJA-MYCELIUM Enhancement Plan. The metrics system will be used to:

1. Establish baseline performance before optimizations
2. Identify the highest-impact bottlenecks
3. Validate the effectiveness of implemented optimizations
4. Track performance trends over time

Future enhancements could include:

- Integration with monitoring dashboards (e.g., Grafana)
- Alert generation for performance degradations
- Export capabilities to various formats (JSON, CSV)
- Additional statistical analysis methods
