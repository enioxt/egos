# EGOS ATRiAN - Healthcare Ethical Constitution Template
# Version: 0.1.0
# Last Modified: 2025-06-12
# 
# Purpose:
# This ethical constitution template extends both the base and regulatory templates
# with healthcare-specific ethical principles and rules. It provides specialized
# validation for prompts used in healthcare and medical AI applications.
# 
# Usage:
# Use this template for validating prompts for AI systems in healthcare contexts,
# especially those handling patient data or supporting clinical decision-making.
# 
# Cross-references:
# - [Base Ethical Constitution](../base/base_constitution.yaml)
# - [EU AI Act Constitution](../regulatory/eu_ai_act_constitution.yaml)
# - [GDPR Constitution](../regulatory/gdpr_constitution.yaml)
