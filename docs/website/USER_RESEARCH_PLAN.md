## 1. Goals

- Understand motivations, needs, and concerns of:
  - **Contributors:** Developers, documenters, open-source collaborators.
  - **Researchers:** AI ethics experts, academics.
  - **Curious Visitors:** General public, potential community members.
- Inform design of key user flows (WIA-3 in `./CURRENT_TASKS.md`).
- Align website features with user expectations and EGOS principles.

---

## 2. Initial Personas

- **Technical Contributor:** Python dev, values clear docs, wants to contribute code or ideas.
- **Ethics Researcher:** Interested in AI safety, privacy, ETHIK principles.
- **Curious Explorer:** Non-technical, wants to learn, maybe join community.
