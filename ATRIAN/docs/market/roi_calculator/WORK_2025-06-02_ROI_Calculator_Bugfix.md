# WORK LOG: ATRiAN Ethics ROI Calculator Bugfix

**Date:** 2025-06-02  
**Author:** EGOS Team  
**Task:** Fix bugs in the multi-industry ROI calculator example suite

## 1. Error Identification

### 1.1 Error Description
When running the full multi-industry analysis with comparative charts, the following error occurs:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\docs\market\roi_calculator\example_usage.py", line 2083, in <module>
    result = run_all_examples()
  File "C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\docs\market\roi_calculator\example_usage.py", line 2039, in run_all_examples
    healthcare_calc, healthcare_results = run_healthcare_example()
  File "C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\docs\market\roi_calculator\example_usage.py", line 757, in run_healthcare_example
    irr = calculate_irr(results.cash_flows)
AttributeError: 'ROIResults' object has no attribute 'cash_flows'
```

### 1.2 Root Cause Analysis
- The `ROIResults` class in `atrian_roi_calculator.py` does not have a `cash_flows` attribute
- The `run_healthcare_example()` function is trying to access this non-existent attribute
- This prevents the generation of comparative charts and reports across industries

## 2. Resolution Plan

Following the systematic debugging approach for ATRiAN components:

1. **Fix the immediate error**: Modify the `run_healthcare_example()` function to manually create cash flows for IRR calculation instead of trying to access a non-existent attribute
2. **Ensure consistency**: Apply the same fix to all other industry example functions
3. **Validate the fix**: Run the script with the `--industry all` option to verify all examples run successfully
4. **Generate outputs**: Ensure all charts and reports are generated correctly

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Cash Flows Fix
The first fix involved:
1. Creating a manual cash flow array in each industry example function
2. Using the existing yearly benefits and costs from the results object
3. Ensuring the IRR calculation works correctly with the manually created cash flows

### 3.2 Attribute Name Inconsistency Fixes
After fixing the cash flows issue, we discovered multiple attribute name inconsistencies:

#### 3.2.1 ROI Percentage Attribute
1. The `calculate_roi()` method in `ATRiANROICalculator` class sets `roi_percentage` as the attribute name for ROI percentage
2. However, the industry example functions were incorrectly referencing `results.roi` instead of `results.roi_percentage`
3. We fixed this inconsistency in all three affected industry examples (healthcare, manufacturing, and retail)

#### 3.2.2 Additional Attribute Inconsistencies
Further testing revealed several more attribute naming inconsistencies across all industry examples:

1. **NPV attribute**:
   - Code used: `results.npv`
   - Actual attribute: The calculator has `net_benefits` for NPV
   - Fixed by replacing all instances with `results.net_benefits`

2. **Payback period attribute**:
   - Code used: `results.payback_period`
   - Actual attribute: `results.payback_period_months` (stored in months, not years)
   - Fixed by replacing with `results.payback_period_months / 12` to convert to years

3. **Initial investment attribute**:
   - Code used: `results.initial_investment`
   - Not directly set in the `calculate_roi` method
   - Fixed by using `calculator.inputs.implementation_cost` instead

4. **Benefits/costs totals**:
   - Code used: `results.total_benefits_npv` and `results.total_costs_npv`
   - Actual attributes: `results.npv_benefits` and `results.npv_costs`
   - Fixed by replacing with the correct attribute names

These inconsistencies appeared in all three industry examples (healthcare, manufacturing, and retail) and were fixed consistently across all examples.

### 3.3 IRR Calculation Error Handling
After fixing the attribute inconsistencies, we encountered an issue with the IRR calculation:

1. The `calculate_irr()` function in example_usage.py can return `None` when it can't find a valid IRR solution
2. The code was not handling this case, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__` error
3. Created a fix script (`fix_irr_handling.py`) to systematically update all industry examples
4. Implemented proper error handling by replacing `print(f"IRR: {irr:.2f}%")` with conditional formatting that displays "N/A" when IRR is None

## 4. Expected Outcomes
- ✅ All industry examples now run without errors
- ✅ Comparative analysis charts are generated in the charts directory
- ✅ JSON reports are created for all industries and the comparative analysis
- Executive summaries should be generated for all analyses
