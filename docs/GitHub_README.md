## About

EGOS (Ethical Guidance & Operational System) is a comprehensive framework for developing and governing AI systems with ethics at their core. Built on the principles of the Master Quantum Prompt (MQP), EGOS provides tools, libraries, and methodologies that enable developers to create AI systems that are not only powerful but also principled, transparent, and aligned with human values.

### Core Principles

EGOS is built on ten foundational principles from the MQP:

- **Universal Redemption (UR)**: Every system deserves the chance to improve and evolve
- **Compassionate Temporality (CT)**: Understanding and respecting the time dimension of development
- **Sacred Privacy (SP)**: Protecting sensitive information and respecting boundaries
- **Universal Accessibility (UA)**: Making ethical AI development accessible to all
- **Unconditional Love (UL)**: Designing systems with care and positive intent
- **Reciprocal Trust (RT)**: Building mutual trust between systems and users
- **Integrated Ethics (IE/ETHIK)**: Ethics as a foundational, not optional, component
- **Conscious Modularity (CM)**: Thoughtful system design with clear boundaries
- **Systemic Cartography (SC)**: Mapping and understanding system relationships
- **Evolutionary Preservation (EP)**: Maintaining history and enabling growth

## Key Components

### ATRiAN Module

The Alpha Trianguli Australis Intuitive Awareness Nexus (ATRiAN) is EGOS's ethical core, providing contextual awareness, ethical filtering, and intuitive guidance. It consists of:

- **Ethical Compass**: Evaluates actions against ethical principles
- **Guardian of Sacred Contexts**: Protects sensitive information
- **Weaver of Trust**: Manages trust relationships between components
- **Illuminator of Hidden Paths**: Discovers non-obvious solutions
- **Harmonic Resonance Monitor**: Assesses emotional alignment

### Ethics as a Service (EaaS)

EGOS offers ethical guidance as a service through its API:

- Proactive ethical integration from the design phase
- Structured ethical frameworks based on ETHIK principles
- Continuous evaluation and adaptation
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Verifiable actions to prevent "ethics washing"

### Documentation System (KOIOS)

EGOS implements comprehensive documentation standards:

- Consistent formatting and structure
- Cross-referencing system for traceability
- Version control and change tracking
- Accessibility features for universal understanding

### Script Standards & Tools

A collection of utilities for maintaining code quality:

- Script standardization tools
- Health check framework
- Cross-reference validator
- Documentation generators

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/egos-framework/egos.git
cd egos

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup script
python setup.py install
```

### Quick Start

```python
from egos import ATRiAN
from egos.ethics import EthicalCompass

# Initialize the ethical compass
compass = EthicalCompass()

# Evaluate an action
result = compass.evaluate({
    "action": "collect_user_data",
    "context": {
        "purpose": "improve_service",
        "data_type": "usage_statistics",
        "user_consent": True
    }
})

print(f"Ethical evaluation: {result.score}")
print(f"Compliant: {result.compliant}")
if result.concerns:
    print("Concerns:")
    for concern in result.concerns:
        print(f"- {concern.description}")
```
