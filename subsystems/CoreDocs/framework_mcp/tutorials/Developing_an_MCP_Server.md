# Tutorial: Developing an EGOS MCP Server

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the EGOS Framework! This tutorial guides you through the process of developing a Model-Context-Prompt (MCP) Server, a fundamental component for extending the capabilities of the EGOS ecosystem.

### What is an MCP in the EGOS Framework?
An MCP Server in EGOS is a specialized microservice that exposes a set of capabilities (tools or functions) that AI agents or other EGOS services can interact with. These servers adhere to standardized communication protocols and design principles, ensuring interoperability, security, and ethical operation within the framework.

### Purpose of this Tutorial
This tutorial aims to provide developers with:
- A clear understanding of the EGOS MCP development lifecycle.
- Practical steps to design, implement, test, and document an MCP server.
- An example MCP server to illustrate the concepts.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A working installation of Python (version 3.9 or higher is recommended).
- Basic familiarity with FastAPI and Pydantic.
- An understanding of the core EGOS Philosophy and Principles (refer to `C:\EGOS\EGOS_Framework\docs\01_Philosophy_and_Principles.md` and `C:\EGOS\MQP.md`).
- Access to the `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md` (located at `C:\EGOS\docs\core_materials\standards\EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md`) as this tutorial will frequently reference it.

## 2. Understanding EGOS MCP Standards

Adherence to the EGOS MCP standards is crucial for creating robust, secure, and interoperable MCPs.

### Overview of `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md`
The `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md` is the definitive document for all MCP development. It covers API design, security, logging, documentation, and more. We will highlight key aspects in this tutorial, but you should consider it your primary reference.

### Core Principles
All MCPs must embody the EGOS core principles, including but not limited to:
- **ETHIK by Design:** Integrate ethical considerations throughout the lifecycle.
- **KOIOS-Integrated:** Leverage KOIOS for contextual information and knowledge.
- **MYCELIUM-Connected:** Utilize MYCELIUM for standardized communication.
- **GUARDIAN-Secured:** Implement robust security measures.
- **NEXUS-Aware:** Declare dependencies and relationships via NEXUS.
- **CRONOS-Preserved:** Ensure all artifacts are versioned and preserved.
- **HARMONY-Compliant:** Aim for cross-platform compatibility.

### Importance of Adherence
Following these standards ensures that your MCP can seamlessly integrate into the broader EGOS ecosystem, communicate effectively with other components, and uphold the framework's commitment to ethical and resilient AI.

## 3. Setting up Your Development Environment

### Python Version
EGOS recommends Python 3.9+.

### Installing Dependencies
For this tutorial, we'll use FastAPI for building the web server and Uvicorn as the ASGI server.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Recommended Project Structure
A typical MCP server project might look like this:

```
my_mcp_server/
├── main.py             # FastAPI application instance and endpoint definitions
├── models.py           # Pydantic models for request/response schemas
├── services.py         # Business logic for your MCP's capabilities
├── config.py           # Configuration management
├── tests/              # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── test_main.py
│   └── ...
├── openapi.yaml        # OpenAPI specification (can be auto-generated)
├── README.md           # MCP-specific documentation
└── .env                # Environment variables (optional, for local dev)
```

## 4. Designing Your MCP Server

Careful design is key to a successful MCP.

### Defining Purpose and Scope
Clearly define what your MCP will do. What capabilities will it offer? What problems will it solve? For our example, we'll create a simple `GreeterMCP` that provides a greeting service.

### API Design with OpenAPI
EGOS mandates the use of OpenAPI 3.x for API specification. This ensures clarity and facilitates automated tooling. Refer to **Appendix A** of the `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md` for a detailed template.

- **Endpoints:** Define clear, resource-oriented endpoints.
- **Request/Response Schemas:** Use Pydantic models to define your data structures. FastAPI will automatically use these for validation and serialization.
- **Example (`GreeterMCP`):**
    - Endpoint: `POST /greet`
    - Request Body: `{"name": "string"}`
    - Response Body: `{"message": "string"}`

### Data Models (Pydantic)
Define Pydantic models for all request and response bodies. This provides data validation and type hinting.

```python
# models.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GreetRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str

class GreetResponse(BaseModel):
    message: str
```

### Security Considerations
Security is paramount. Your MCP must integrate with GUARDIAN for authentication and authorization as specified in the guidelines. This typically involves:
- Validating API keys or tokens.
- Enforcing access control based on defined scopes.

### Error Handling
Standardized error responses are crucial for predictability. The guidelines specify a common error response format. Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and return these standard responses.

Example Error Response (as per guidelines):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid input: 'name' field is required.",
  "path": "/greet"
}
```

## 5. Implementing Your MCP Server (Example: `GreeterMCP`)

Let's implement our `GreeterMCP`.

### Main Application File (`main.py`)

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from models import GreetRequest, GreetResponse
import logging
import datetime

# Configure logging (as per EGOS guidelines)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

app = FastAPI(
    title="GreeterMCP",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="A simple MCP that provides personalized greetings.",
    # Add other OpenAPI metadata as per EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md
)

@app.post("/greet", response_model=GreetResponse)
async def greet_person(request: GreetRequest):
    logger.info(f"Received greet request for: {request.name}")
    if not request.name:
        logger.error("Validation Error: Name field cannot be empty.")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail={
                "timestamp": datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
                "status": 400,
                "error": "Bad Request",
                "message": "Validation Error: Name field cannot be empty.",
                "path": "/greet"
            }
        )
    
    greeting_message = f"Hello, {request.name}! Welcome to the EGOS Framework."
    logger.info(f"Generated greeting: {greeting_message}")
    return GreetResponse(message=greeting_message)

# Placeholder for ETHIK integration, GUARDIAN security hooks, etc.
# For a real MCP, these would be critical integrations.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Business Logic (`services.py` - if complex)
For more complex MCPs, separate business logic into a `services.py` file to keep `main.py` clean.

### Configuration Management (`config.py`)
Use a `config.py` or environment variables for managing settings like API keys, database URLs, etc., as per EGOS guidelines.

## 6. Testing Your MCP Server

Thorough testing is mandatory.

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and modules.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between components, including API endpoints.
- **Example (using `pytest` and `httpx`):

```python
# tests/test_main.py
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app # Assuming your FastAPI app instance is named 'app'

client = TestClient(app)

def test_greet_success():
    response = client.post("/greet", json={"name": "Alice"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello, Alice! Welcome to the EGOS Framework."}

def test_greet_no_name():
    response = client.post("/greet", json={"name": ""})
    assert response.status_code == 400
    # Further assert the structure of the error message as per guidelines
    error_data = response.json()["detail"]
    assert error_data["status"] == 400
    assert error_data["error"] == "Bad Request"
    assert "Name field cannot be empty" in error_data["message"]
```

Refer to Section 7 ("Testing and Quality Assurance") of the `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md` for detailed requirements.

## 7. Documenting Your MCP Server

Comprehensive documentation is a cornerstone of KOIOS.

- **`README.md`:** Each MCP must have its own `README.md` detailing its purpose, setup, API usage, and any specific considerations.
- **OpenAPI Documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema (usually at `/openapi.json`) and interactive API documentation (Swagger UI at `/docs`, ReDoc at `/redoc`). Ensure this is accurate and complete by providing rich metadata in your FastAPI app and Pydantic models.
- **Product Brief:** As per Section 9.1 of the guidelines, a **Product Brief** is required for each MCP. This document provides a high-level overview, technical details, and strategic alignment. Store Product Briefs in `C:\EGOS\docs\mcp_product_briefs\`.

## 8. Deployment Considerations

While detailed deployment strategies are beyond this initial tutorial, keep in mind:
- **Containerization:** Docker is often recommended.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or similar platforms for managing deployed MCPs.
- **Configuration:** Securely manage configurations for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- Refer to Section 10 ("Deployment and Operations") of the `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md`.

## 9. Interacting with the EGOS Ecosystem

Your MCP doesn't live in isolation. It will need to:
- **Register with MYCELIUM:** To be discoverable and allow standardized communication.
- **Consult ETHIK:** For validating actions, especially those with ethical implications.
- **Utilize KOIOS:** For accessing shared knowledge and context.
- **Integrate with GUARDIAN:** For security enforcement.
- **Declare relationships via NEXUS:** To map its place within the EGOS component graph.

These integrations are critical and are detailed in their respective subsystem documentation and the main MCP guidelines.
