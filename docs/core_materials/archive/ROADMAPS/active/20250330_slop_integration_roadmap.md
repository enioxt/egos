# SLOP Integration Roadmap
Version: 1.2
Last Updated: 2025-03-30
Status: 95% Complete

## Current Status Overview
The SLOP server implementation is now at 95% completion, with recent progress in file organization and structure optimization. The system is operational with enhanced WebSocket performance and a clean, maintainable codebase structure.

## Existing Components
- Core SLOP server (100% complete)
- WebSocket optimizations (100% complete)
- Connection pooling (100% complete)
- Message caching (100% complete)
- File system organization (100% complete)
- Configuration management (100% complete)
- Logging system (100% complete)
- Test suite (95% complete)
