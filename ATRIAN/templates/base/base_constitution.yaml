# EGOS ATRiAN - Base Ethical Constitution Template
# Version: 0.1.0
# Last Modified: 2025-06-12
# 
# Purpose:
# This file defines the base ethical constitution template that serves as a foundation
# for all specialized ethical constitutions in the ATRiAN system. It establishes the
# core ethical principles and rules that should be inherited by all derived constitutions.
# 
# Usage:
# This template can be extended by specialized templates for specific regulatory
# frameworks (EU AI Act, GDPR) or industry sectors (healthcare, finance).
# 
# Cross-references:
# - [ATRiAN README](../../README.md)
# - [Ethics Rules YAML](../../ethics_rules.yaml)
# - [Ethical Constitution Schema](./ethical_constitution_schema.py)
