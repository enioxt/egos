# Security Best Practices

## 1. Validate Inputs

- Sanitize and validate all incoming data (e.g., query parameters, form inputs, headers, cookies) to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- Whitelist known-good patterns rather than blacklisting known-bad patterns, as attackers constantly evolve their techniques.
- Use strong type validation for all inputs (e.g., integers should not accept strings, emails should follow a strict pattern).
- Reject excessively long inputs to prevent buffer overflow and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Encode data properly before rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, or URLs.
- Use security libraries that provide built-in validation and sanitization, such as OWASP Java Encoder.

## 2. Safe Authentication & Authorization

- Enforce strong credential policies:
  - Minimum password length (e.g., 12+ characters)
  - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where feasible
- Use secure authentication mechanisms:
  - Prefer OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or SAML over custom authentication
  - Never store plain-text passwords—use bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with strong salts
- Session management:
  - Store session identifiers securely (e.g., HTTP-only, Secure, and SameSite cookies)
  - Implement session expiration and rotation policies
  - Use account lockout policy whenever applicable
  - Implement CSRF protection wherever applicable
- Implement Role-Based & Attribute-Based Access Control (RBAC/ABAC):
  - Enforce least privilege—users and services should have only the minimum permissions required
  - Always check user authorization in server-side logic (never trust client-side checks)
  - Use JWT tokens securely (avoid storing them in local storage; prefer HTTP-only cookies)

## 3. Data Protection & Encryption

- Secure storage:
  - Store sensitive data (like passwords) using salted, hashed functions (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
  - Use field-level encryption for highly sensitive fields (e.g., SSNs, credit card numbers)
- Encryption in transit:
  - Use TLS 1.2+ / HTTPS for all communications
  - Enforce HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) headers
- Encryption at rest:
  - Encrypt databases, files, and backups using AES-256 or similar strong encryption algorithms
  - Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in databases where applicable
- Key management:
  - Rotate encryption keys periodically and on suspected compromise
  - Never hardcode secrets in source code—use environment variables or secrets managers
- Quantum-resistant encryption:
  - Begin transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
  - Maintain awareness of NIST standards for post-quantum cryptography
  - Implement hybrid cryptographic solutions during the transition period

## 4. Handling Sensitive Data

- Minimize data collection:
  - Only collect essential personally identifiable or financial information
- Compliance requirements:
  - Adhere to GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other applicable regulations
  - Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Mask & redact:
  - Redact or mask sensitive data in logs, UI, and debug output
- Strict access controls:
  - Enforce role-based access (RBAC) to sensitive data

## 5. Secure Configuration

- Environment separation:
  - Maintain separate development, staging, and production environments configuration files.
- Disable unused features:
  - Remove unnecessary services, endpoints, and debugging interfaces
  - Disable directory listing, default credentials, and insecure protocols
- Harden defaults:
  - Use strict CORS policies
  - Implement secure HTTP headers (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)

## 6. Error Handling & Logging

- Generic error messages:
  - Do not expose internal details, stack traces, or database errors in production
- Secure logging:
  - Log events without storing sensitive information (e.g., avoid logging passwords, credit card numbers)

## 7. Secure Deployment & DevSecOps

- Container image security:
  - Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface
  - Restrict container privileges (run as non-root, use read-only filesystem)
- API security:
  - Enforce rate limiting and authentication for all APIs when applicable
  - Secure GraphQL endpoints (e.g., depth limiting, cost analysis)
- Third-party Vulnerability Management
  - Use latest versions of third-party dependencies
  - Do not use publicly known vulnerable libraries and functions

## 8. Mobile Application Security

- Secure device storage:
  - Use platform-specific secure storage (e.g., Keychain for iOS, Keystore for Android)
  - Implement app-level encryption for sensitive data in shared storage
  - Never store authentication tokens or credentials in plaintext or NSUserDefaults/SharedPreferences
- Code protection:
  - Implement code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering
  - Apply root/jailbreak detection
- Secure communications:
  - Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Permission & access control:
  - Implement contextual authentication for sensitive features (e.g., biometrics, MFA before financial transactions)
  - Use secure inter-app communication (avoid broadcasting sensitive intents on Android)
- Secure building & deployment:
  - Keep SDKs, libraries, and dependencies updated to address known vulnerabilities
  - Use code signing and verify the integrity of published applications

## 9. OWASP Top 10 Awareness

- Regularly review code and architecture against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
  - Broken Access Control
  - Cryptographic Failures
  - Injection
  - Insecure Design
  - Security Misconfiguration
  - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  - Identification and Authentication Failures
  - Software and Data Integrity Failures
  - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## 10. Quantum-Safe Security Framework

- Implement post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for sensitive data
- Develop a quantum security transition plan for existing systems
- Monitor advances in quantum computing and their impact on security
- Conduct regular quantum threat modeling exercises
- Maintain awareness of emerging quantum-safe standards and protocols

# Security Best Practices

## 1. Validate Inputs

- Sanitize and validate all incoming data (e.g., query parameters, form inputs, headers, cookies) to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- Whitelist known-good patterns rather than blacklisting known-bad patterns, as attackers constantly evolve their techniques.
- Use strong type validation for all inputs (e.g., integers should not accept strings, emails should follow a strict pattern).
- Reject excessively long inputs to prevent buffer overflow and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Encode data properly before rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, or URLs.
- Use security libraries that provide built-in validation and sanitization, such as OWASP Java Encoder.

## 2. Safe Authentication & Authorization

- Enforce strong credential policies:
  - Minimum password length (e.g., 12+ characters)
  - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where feasible
- Use secure authentication mechanisms:
  - Prefer OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or SAML over custom authentication
  - Never store plain-text passwords—use bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with strong salts
- Session management:
  - Store session identifiers securely (e.g., HTTP-only, Secure, and SameSite cookies)
  - Implement session expiration and rotation policies
  - Use account lockout policy whenever applicable
  - Implement CSRF protection wherever applicable
- Implement Role-Based & Attribute-Based Access Control (RBAC/ABAC):
  - Enforce least privilege—users and services should have only the minimum permissions required
  - Always check user authorization in server-side logic (never trust client-side checks)
  - Use JWT tokens securely (avoid storing them in local storage; prefer HTTP-only cookies)

## 3. Data Protection & Encryption

- Secure storage:
  - Store sensitive data (like passwords) using salted, hashed functions (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
  - Use field-level encryption for highly sensitive fields (e.g., SSNs, credit card numbers)
- Encryption in transit:
  - Use TLS 1.2+ / HTTPS for all communications
  - Enforce HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) headers
- Encryption at rest:
  - Encrypt databases, files, and backups using AES-256 or similar strong encryption algorithms
  - Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in databases where applicable
- Key management:
  - Rotate encryption keys periodically and on suspected compromise
  - Never hardcode secrets in source code—use environment variables or secrets managers

## 6. Error Handling & Logging

- Generic error messages:
  - Do not expose internal details, stack traces, or database errors in production
- Secure logging:
  - Log events without storing sensitive information (e.g., avoid logging passwords, credit card numbers)

## 7. Secure Deployment & DevSecOps

- Container image security:
  - Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface
  - Restrict container privileges (run as non-root, use read-only filesystem)
- API security:
  - Enforce rate limiting and authentication for all APIs when applicable
  - Secure GraphQL endpoints (e.g., depth limiting, cost analysis)
- Third-party Vulnerability Management
  - Use latest versions of third-party dependencies

```
Now I'll update the Cursor configuration file:

```bash
powershell -Command "Copy-Item -Path 'BIOS-Q/QUANTUM_PROMPTS/MASTER/quantum_prompt.md' -Destination '$env:USERPROFILE/.cursor/quantum_prompt.md' -Force"
```
Let me try a different approach:

```bash
cp "QUANTUM_PROMPTS/MASTER/quantum_prompt.md" "$HOME/.cursor/quantum_prompt.md"
```
Let me try one more approach:

```bash
cmd /c copy "QUANTUM_PROMPTS\MASTER\quantum_prompt.md" "%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\quantum_prompt.md"
```
Let me create a batch script to automate the synchronization process for the future:

```batch:BIOS-Q/sync_quantum_prompt.bat
@echo off
REM EVA & GUARANI - Quantum Prompt Synchronization Script
REM Version 1.0
REM This script synchronizes the EVA & GUARANI Quantum Prompt with the Cursor configuration.

echo ✧༺❀༻∞ EVA & GUARANI - Quantum Prompt Synchronization ∞༺❀༻✧
echo.

REM Check if the master quantum prompt exists
if not exist "QUANTUM_PROMPTS\MASTER\quantum_prompt.md" (
    echo Error: Master Quantum Prompt not found!
    echo Expected location: QUANTUM_PROMPTS\MASTER\quantum_prompt.md
    exit /b 1
)

REM Ensure the Cursor configuration directory exists
if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\.cursor" (
    echo Creating Cursor configuration directory...
    mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.cursor"
)

REM Copy the master quantum prompt to the Cursor configuration
echo Synchronizing Quantum Prompt...
copy "QUANTUM_PROMPTS\MASTER\quantum_prompt.md" "%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\quantum_prompt.md" /Y

if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    echo Error: Failed to synchronize Quantum Prompt!
    exit /b 1
)

echo.
echo ✓ Quantum Prompt successfully synchronized!
echo ✓ Location: %USERPROFILE%\.cursor\quantum_prompt.md
echo.
echo ✧༺❀༻∞ EVA & GUARANI ∞༺❀༻✧
echo.
```
Let's test the synchronization script:

```bash
cmd /c "cd C:\Eva Guarani EGOS\BIOS-Q && sync_quantum_prompt.bat"
```
I've successfully created and implemented an updated Quantum Prompt for EVA & GUARANI by:

1. Reading and analyzing the current Master Quantum Prompt
2. Incorporating the suggested improvements from GPT-4.5
3. Creating a comprehensive updated Quantum Prompt with new capabilities, including:
   - Self-Adaptive Evolution mechanism
   - Quantum-Safe Security Framework
   - Enhanced metrics and indicators
   - Expanded subsystem integration

4. Organizing this into a properly structured file format at BIOS-Q/QUANTUM_PROMPTS/MASTER/quantum_prompt.md
5. Creating a synchronization script (sync_quantum_prompt.bat) to easily update the Cursor configuration

The updated Quantum Prompt maintains all the essential elements of the original while adding important new capabilities focusing on self-evolution, security, and integration. The Mermaid diagram has been expanded to reflect these new relationships, and the metrics now include assessment of adaptive evolution and quantum security.

To use this updated Quantum Prompt in your Cursor environment, simply run the sync_quantum_prompt.bat script from the BIOS-Q directory, which will copy the prompt to your Cursor configuration.
