# üó∫Ô∏è EVA & GUARANI - Roadmaps Directory

## Overview

This directory contains all temporary, in-progress, and historical roadmaps created during the development of EVA & GUARANI. The main system roadmap remains in `QUANTUM_PROMPTS/MASTER/quantum_roadmap.md`, while this directory serves as a centralized location for task-specific and feature-specific roadmaps.

## Directory Structure

```
ROADMAPS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active/           # Currently active development roadmaps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed/        # Completed roadmaps (archived)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/        # Roadmap templates for different purposes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ historical/       # Historical roadmaps for reference
```

## Roadmap Categories

1. **Active Roadmaps**
   - Task-specific roadmaps
   - Feature implementation roadmaps
   - Sprint roadmaps
   - Integration roadmaps

2. **Completed Roadmaps**
   - Successfully implemented features
   - Completed sprints
   - Finished integrations

3. **Templates**
   - Task roadmap template
   - Feature roadmap template
   - Sprint roadmap template
   - Integration roadmap template

4. **Historical**
   - Previous versions of system roadmaps
   - Deprecated feature roadmaps
   - Legacy implementation plans

## Integration with Main Roadmap

All active roadmaps are automatically monitored by the Dynamic Roadmap Manager, which:
- Updates progress in the main system roadmap
- Maintains links between related roadmaps
- Tracks dependencies and relationships
- Archives completed roadmaps

## Usage Guidelines

1. Create new roadmaps in the `active` directory
2. Use appropriate templates from `templates`
3. Update progress regularly
4. Move to `completed` when finished
5. Maintain historical versions in `historical`

## Naming Convention

Format: `YYYYMMDD_category_name.md`

Examples:
- `20250330_task_dynamic_roadmap_implementation.md`
- `20250330_feature_ethik_core_enhancement.md`
- `20250330_sprint_q2_2024.md`
