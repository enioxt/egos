# AI Agent Capabilities Research (2025)

**Last Update:** April 2, 2025
**Status:** Research - Initial Findings
**Source:** Web Research - The AI Valley, TechCrunch, Amazon Documentation

## Overview

This document summarizes key findings from research on state-of-the-art AI agents that can autonomously interact with web browsers and applications. These capabilities may be relevant for integration with EGOS subsystems, particularly MYCELIUM and CORUJA.

## Key Agent Technologies (Q1-Q2 2025)

### 1. Amazon Nova Act (Released March 31, 2025)

**Core Capabilities:**

- Browser control and automation for tasks like shopping, form filling, and scheduling
- Task decomposition framework breaking complex workflows into single "acts"
- Developer tools via SDK (nova.amazon.com)
- Conditional actions with intervention points for human oversight
- Claimed performance of 94% on ScreenSpot Web Text benchmark

**Key Concepts:**

- Acts as reliable building blocks for automation
- Developer-defined conditions for human intervention
- Integration with Nova foundation models
- Focused on short, reliable tasks vs. complete autonomy

**Potential Integration Points:**

- MYCELIUM: Framework for task decomposition and reliability metrics
- ETHIK: Validation boundaries for autonomous actions
- CORUJA: Web-based information gathering and processing

### 2. OpenAI Operator (Released January 2025)

**Core Capabilities:**

- Browser navigation and interaction
- Form filling and data extraction
- Screenshot interpretation and visual understanding

**Limitations Noted:**

- Reliability issues across different domains
- Slow processing
- Limited autonomy duration
- Prone to "non-human" errors

### 3. Anthropic Computer Use (Released October 2024)

**Core Capabilities:**

- Screen visualization and interpretation
- Cursor movement and control
- Button clicking and text entry
- Measured at 90% on ScreenSpot Web Text benchmark

**Limitations Similar to Operator:**

- Reliability challenges
- Speed and autonomy constraints

## Key Architectural Insights for EGOS

1. **Task Decomposition Strategy**: Nova Act's approach of breaking complex tasks into smaller, reliable units with clear success criteria aligns well with EGOS's modular philosophy.

2. **Human Oversight Framework**: The concept of defining precise intervention points addresses ETHIK concerns about autonomous AI actions.

3. **Reliability Metrics**: Benchmarks like ScreenSpot Web Text provide concrete evaluation frameworks that could inform EGOS agent development.

4. **Integration with Foundation Models**: Nova Act's connection to the broader Nova ecosystem demonstrates the value of a unified approach similar to our MYCELIUM concept.

## Potential EGOS Applications

1. **KOIOS Enhanced Research**: Autonomous gathering of documentation, standards, and references from the web.

2. **CRONOS Automated Backups**: Scheduling and verification of external backups through web interfaces.

3. **ETHIK Web Content Validation**: Automated scanning and validation of web content against ethical guidelines.

4. **MYCELIUM External System Integration**: Bridge between internal EGOS components and external web services without direct API integration.

5. **CORUJA Web-Assisted Q&A**: Enhanced question answering with real-time web research capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Conduct deeper analysis of Nova Act SDK and benchmarking methodologies
2. Evaluate potential prototype architecture for EGOS-specific implementation
3. Identify initial use cases that align with current project priorities
4. Define ETHIK boundaries for autonomous agent actions
