# EGOS System - ATRiAN Module: Ethics Rules Configuration
# Version: 1.1
# Last Modified: 2025-06-01
# 
# Purpose:
# This file defines the core ethical rules and principles for the EGOS system.
# It is primarily used by the ATRiAN 'Ethical Compass' functionality (see ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md Section 4.1)
# to guide decision-making and ensure actions align with MQP tenets and EaaS principles.
# 
# Structure:
# The file contains a root key 'ethics', which is a list of rule objects.
# Each rule object should have:
#   - 'id': A unique identifier (e.g., ER-001) for easy reference.
#   - 'principle': The overarching ethical principle, preferably mapped to MQP tenets.
#   - 'rule': A concise, actionable statement of the rule.
#   - 'severity': The importance level ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical').
#   - 'scope': Specifies if the rule applies to specific domains or contexts.
#   - 'keywords': A list of keywords that might trigger this rule during analysis.
#   - 'recommendations': Suggested actions when this rule is relevant.
#   - 'mqp_alignment': Which MQP principles this rule implements (e.g., SP, IE, RT).
# 
# Guidance for Modification:
# - Rules should be clear, unambiguous, and directly reflect MQP principles.
# - New rules should be added to the list, maintaining the structure.
# - Consider the implications of each rule on system behavior and user experience.
# - Regularly review and update rules based on evolving ethical understanding and system needs (EGOS_PROCESS:Evolutionary_Refinement_Cycle).
