# CORUJA-MYCELIUM: Circuit Breaker Implementation

## Task Description

Implement the circuit breaker pattern in the CORUJA-MYCELIUM adapter for resilient communication. This pattern prevents cascading failures when external services are unavailable and enables graceful recovery.

## Implementation Details

- **Extracted circuit breaker** from `integration/mycelium_integration.py` into a standalone reusable implementation
- **Created dedicated module** `adapters/circuit_breaker.py` for broader use across the project
- **Enhanced the circuit breaker** with additional features:
  - Better state management with clear transitions
  - Improved reporting capabilities
  - Generic typing for better type checking
  - Comprehensive logging
  - Structured state reporting
- **Integrated circuit breaker** into the CORUJA-MYCELIUM adapter:
  - Created separate circuit breakers for publish and request operations
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Added state reporting methods
- **Implemented comprehensive tests** for both the circuit breaker and its integration with the adapter

## Technical Specifications

The implementation follows the standard circuit breaker pattern with three states:

1. **CLOSED**: Normal operation, all requests pass through
2. **OPEN**: Service is failing, requests are blocked
3. **HALF_OPEN**: Testing if the service has recovered

### Key Features:

- **Configurable thresholds**: Customizable failure count before opening
- **Recovery timeout**: Automatic transition to half-open state after timeout
- **Concurrent operation**: Thread-safe using asyncio locks
- **State inspection**: Easy access to circuit state for monitoring
- **Clean interface**: Simple async execution model

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite implemented to verify:

- Correct state transitions (closed → open → half-open → closed)
- Error handling
- Concurrent operation
- Integration with CORUJA-MYCELIUM adapter
- Recovery behavior

## Additional Notes

This implementation completes a key resilience feature identified in the CORUJA-MYCELIUM Enhancement Plan. The circuit breaker is now available for use not only in the MYCELIUM adapter but potentially in other integration points requiring similar resilience patterns.

The implementation ensures proper handling of transient failures in the MYCELIUM network, preventing cascading failures and allowing for automatic recovery when the network becomes available again.

## Recommended Future Enhancements

- Add metrics collection for circuit breaker state changes
- Implement dashboard visualization of circuit states
- Consider adding configuration via environment variables or configuration files
