        ## Health Assessment
        
        The current cross-reference health score is **0.0%**.
        
        ### Recommendations
        
        1. Address orphaned files by adding appropriate references to them
        2. Improve link density by ensuring related documents reference each other
        3. Review central files to ensure they maintain high quality as they are heavily referenced
