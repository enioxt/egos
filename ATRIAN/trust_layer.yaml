# EGOS System - ATRiAN Module: Trust Layer Configuration
# Version: 1.0
# Last Modified: {{ CURRENT_DATE_TIME_ISO }}
# 
# Purpose:
# This file defines the trust relationships and delegation rules between different EGOS agents or components.
# It is primarily used by the ATRiAN 'Weaver of Trust' functionality (see ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md Section 4.5)
# to manage access control, task delegation, and ensure Reciprocal Trust (RT).
# 
# Structure:
# The file contains a root key 'trust_rules', which is a list of agent-specific rule objects.
# Each rule object should define:
#   - 'agent': The name or identifier of the EGOS agent/component.
#   - 'level': A predefined trust level (e.g., 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'system_critical', 'user_sandboxed').
#   - 'delegation': Specifies the scope of actions this agent can delegate or be delegated (e.g., 'full', 'partial', 'read_only', 'none', or specific action categories).
#   - 'allowed_actions': (Optional) A list of specific actions or operations this agent is permitted to perform.
#   - 'can_delegate_to': (Optional) A list of other agents this agent is allowed to delegate tasks to.
#   - 'context_access_permissions': (Optional) Rules governing access to contexts managed by the Guardian of Sacred Contexts.
# 
# Guidance for Modification:
# - Define trust levels and delegation capabilities carefully to maintain system security and integrity.
# - Ensure rules align with the Principle of Least Privilege.
# - New agents or components requiring trust management should be added here.
# - Regularly review these rules as the EGOS system evolves (EGOS_PROCESS:Evolutionary_Refinement_Cycle).
