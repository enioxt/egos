# EGOS Project Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-17
**Status:** Active

## 1. Introduction

EGOS (Eva Guarani Operating System) is a next-generation, ethically-grounded framework designed for symbiotic human-AI collaboration in software development and beyond. It aims to create a unified, intelligent, and adaptable environment that integrates advanced AI capabilities with robust development practices and a strong philosophical foundation.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Principles

EGOS operates on a set of fundamental principles that guide its development and operation. These principles, detailed in the [MQP (Master Quantum Prompt)](MQP.md) and [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md), emphasize:

*   **Ethical Foundation (ETHIK):** Integrated ethics, privacy, accessibility, and unconditional positive regard as core design elements.
*   **Systemic Integration (MYCELIUM):** Deep interconnectedness and communication between all components.
*   **Conscious Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns and well-defined subsystem responsibilities.
*   **Knowledge & Standards (KOIOS):** Centralized management of standards, documentation, and project knowledge.
*   **Temporal Awareness & Preservation (CRONOS):** Respect for evolution, versioning, and history.
*   **Analysis & Understanding (NEXUS):** Tools for code analysis, dependency mapping, and complexity management.
*   **Harmony & Adaptability (HARMONY):** Ensuring cross-platform compatibility and system resilience.
*   **User Interaction & Orchestration (CORUJA, ATLAS):** Interfaces for human and AI interaction, visualization, and task management.
*   *(Refer to [MQP.md](MQP.md) for the complete list and detailed explanations)*

## 3. High-Level Architecture

EGOS employs a modular, subsystem-based architecture. Each subsystem encapsulates a specific domain of functionality, communicating via defined interfaces (often managed by MYCELIUM). Key subsystems include:

*   **KOIOS:** Knowledge, Standards, Documentation, Validation.
*   **CRONOS:** Time, Versioning, History, Backups, State Management.
*   **NEXUS:** Code Analysis, Dependency Graphing, Complexity Metrics.
*   **MYCELIUM:** Inter-subsystem Communication Bus, Message Schemas.
*   **ETHIK:** Ethical Validation, Privacy Enforcement, Principle Alignment.
*   **HARMONY:** Environment Adaptation, Cross-Platform Compatibility (e.g., Windows).
*   **CORUJA:** Orchestration, Task Management, User/AI Interaction Interface.
*   **ATLAS:** Visualization, System Cartography, Data Representation.
*   *(Refer to [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for more detailed diagrams and descriptions)*

## 4. Goals

*   Create a highly efficient and collaborative development environment.
*   Embed ethical considerations directly into the system's fabric.
*   Leverage AI to augment human capabilities while ensuring human oversight.
*   Produce high-quality, maintainable, and adaptable software.
*   Serve as a blueprint for future integrated AI-human systems.
