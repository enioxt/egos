# EGOS Model-Context-Prompt (MCP) Standardization Guidelines

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-24
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the standardization guidelines for designing, developing, deploying, and managing Model-Context-Prompts (MCPs) within the EGOS ecosystem. The purpose is to ensure that all EGOS MCPs are secure, reliable, interoperable, well-documented, and aligned with the EGOS Master Quantum Prompt (MQP), core subsystem principles (ETHIK, KOIOS, MYCELIUM, GUARDIAN, NEXUS, CRONOS, HARMONY), and industry best practices.

These guidelines are informed by emerging industry standards, such as those highlighted by Microsoft's adoption of MCP, and are enhanced by EGOS's unique commitment to ethical and resilient systems.

## 2. Core Principles for EGOS MCPs

All EGOS MCPs must adhere to the following core principles:

*   **ETHIK by Design:** Ethical considerations are paramount and must be integrated throughout the MCP lifecycle. MCPs handling sensitive data or performing impactful actions must consult `ETHIK-ActionValidator` or similar governance mechanisms.
*   **KOIOS-Integrated:** MCPs should leverage KOIOS for contextual information, knowledge retrieval, and maintaining a shared understanding of the EGOS operational environment.
*   **MYCELIUM-Connected:** MCPs will primarily use MYCELIUM for standardized, observable, and resilient inter-service communication, though direct secure HTTP/S with JSON-RPC is the underlying protocol.
*   **GUARDIAN-Secured:** Robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, and auditing, must be implemented and enforced by or in conjunction with GUARDIAN.
*   **NEXUS-Aware:** MCPs should utilize NEXUS to understand and declare their relationships and dependencies with other EGOS components and data sources.
*   **CRONOS-Preserved:** All MCP artifacts (schemas, code, configurations, audit logs) must be versioned, and their history preserved by CRONOS for auditability, reproducibility, and rollback capabilities.
*   **HARMONY-Aligned:** MCPs should strive for harmonious integration within the EGOS ecosystem, minimizing redundancy and maximizing synergy with other components.

## 3. API Design and Development

### 3.1 API Design Principles

3.1.1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: APIs should be easy to understand and use.
3.1.2. **Consistency**: Follow consistent naming conventions, data formats, and error handling patterns.
3.1.3. **Resource-Oriented**: Design APIs around resources where appropriate (e.g., RESTful principles).
3.1.4. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling and provide clear error messages.

3.1.5. **API-First Development**: Adopt an API-first approach. Define and document the API contract (e.g., using OpenAPI specifications) early in the development cycle. This facilitates parallel development, clear communication, and better validation. The ATRiAN EaaS API (`C:/EGOS/ATRiAN/`) serves as a reference for this practice.

### 3.2 API Specification

3.2.1. **OpenAPI Standard**: All MCP APIs MUST be defined using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) version 3.x.
3.2.2. **Schema Definition**: Data models for requests and responses MUST be clearly defined within the OpenAPI specification using JSON Schema.
3.2.3. **Versioning**: Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/endpoint`) from the outset.

### 3.3 Development Practices

3.3.1. **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) is the recommended framework for developing MCP servers due to its performance, ease of use, and automatic OpenAPI generation.
3.3.2. **Modularity**: Design MCPs with modularity in mind. Separate business logic from the API interface layer.
3.3.3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Aim for high test coverage.
3.3.4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize asynchronous programming for I/O-bound operations to enhance performance and scalability.

## 4. Documentation

### 4.1 Documentation Requirements

4.1.1. **Living Document**: Documentation should be treated as a living artifact, kept up-to-date with code changes.
4.1.2. **Clarity and Completeness**: Ensure documentation is clear, concise, comprehensive, and easily accessible.
4.1.3. **API Documentation**: Generate interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI, Redoc) from OpenAPI specifications.

4.1.4. **Comprehensive Module README**: Each MCP module or service MUST include a comprehensive `README.md` file at its root. This README should cover: Purpose and Scope, Core Features, Architecture Overview, API Endpoints (if applicable, with a link to detailed API docs), Setup and Installation, Usage Examples, Contribution Guidelines, and a High-Level Roadmap. Refer to `ATRiAN/README.md` for an exemplary structure.

4.1.5. **Detailed Feature Planning Documents**: For significant features, sub-systems, or integrations (like ATRiAN's EaaS offering), create dedicated planning documents. These should detail the design, technical requirements, integration points, and roadmap, similar to `ATRiAN/EaaS_Integration_Plan.md`.

4.1.6. **Code Comments**: Code should be well-commented, especially for complex logic or non-obvious decisions.

### 4.2 Documentation Location

- API specifications (`openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml`) should reside in the MCP's root directory or a `/api_docs` subdirectory.
- General documentation (READMEs, guides) should be in a `/docs` subdirectory within the MCP's project folder.
- All documentation MUST be version-controlled alongside the MCP code.

## 5. Security

### 5.1 Authentication and Authorization

5.1.1. **GUARDIAN Integration**: MCPs MUST integrate with GUARDIAN for robust authentication and authorization.
5.1.2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to MCPs and their users.
5.1.3. **Secure Credentials Management**: Avoid hardcoding secrets. Use environment variables or a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, integrated via GUARDIAN).

### 5.2 Data Security

5.2.1. **Input Validation**: Rigorously validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
5.2.2. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode output data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) if applicable.
5.2.3. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.

### 5.3 Auditing and Logging

5.3.1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all significant events, requests, responses, and errors.
5.3.2. **Audit Trails**: Maintain immutable audit trails for critical operations, especially those involving data modification or sensitive actions.
5.3.3. **Log Standardization**: Follow EGOS logging standards for format and content (to be defined by MYCELIUM/KOIOS).

## 6. Deployment and Operations

### 6.1 Containerization

6.1.1. **Docker**: All MCPs MUST be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment environments.
6.1.2. **Optimized Images**: Docker images should be optimized for size and security.

### 6.2 Configuration Management

6.2.1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all environment-specific configurations.
6.2.2. **Configuration Files**: For complex configurations, use standardized file formats (e.g., YAML, TOML) and manage them securely.

### 6.3 Monitoring and Alerting

6.3.1. **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints (e.g., `/health`).
6.3.2. **Performance Metrics**: Expose key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring (e.g., request rate, error rate, latency).
6.3.3. **Alerting**: Integrate with EGOS central alerting system for critical issues.

## 7. Interoperability and Integration

### 7.1 Example Implementations

- ATRiAN Ethics as a Service (EaaS) API (`C:/EGOS/ATRiAN/`) - *Also note its comprehensive README and detailed EaaS planning documentation as examples of good practice.*
- Notion MCP Server (`C:/EGOS/scripts/tools/mcp_servers/notion/`)
- OpenRouter MCP Server (`C:/EGOS/scripts/tools/mcp_management/`)

### 7.2 Core EGOS Subsystem Integration

MCPs MUST integrate with core EGOS subsystems as appropriate:
- **ETHIK-ActionValidator**: For ethical review and validation of actions.
- **KOIOS**: For contextual data and knowledge graph interactions.
- **MYCELIUM**: For standardized inter-service communication and eventing.
- **GUARDIAN**: For authentication, authorization, and secrets management.
- **NEXUS**: For service discovery and dependency management.
- **CRONOS**: For versioning and history of MCP artifacts.

## 8. Ethical Considerations (ETHIK Integration)

8.1. **Ethical Review**: All MCPs, especially those interacting with user data, making decisions, or performing actions with real-world consequences, MUST undergo an ETHIK review process.
8.2. **Bias Mitigation**: Actively identify and mitigate potential biases in data, algorithms, and decision-making processes within the MCP.
8.3. **Transparency**: Strive for transparency in MCP operations, especially regarding data usage and decision logic, where feasible and appropriate.
8.4. **Accountability**: Ensure clear lines of accountability for MCP behavior and outcomes.
