### KOIOS Subsystem (Knowledge Organization, Information Storage/Retrieval, and Orchestration System) - Initial Review (2025-05-21)

*   **Status:** Active & Foundational
*   **Path:** `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\KOIOS\`
*   **Initial Files Reviewed:** `KOS_description.md`, `KOS_roadmap.md`, `KOS_architecture.md`, `KOS_standards.md`, `KOS_subsystem_structure.md`, `KOIOS_documentation_audit_summary_20250518.md`.
*   **Key Role & Capabilities:** KOIOS is the central subsystem for knowledge management, documentation standards, information architecture, and process definition within EGOS. It aims to ensure all information is well-organized, accessible, and maintainable. Key components include Chronicler (versioning), Librarian (indexing/retrieval), Cartographer (relationships), and Lexicographer (terminology). It defines MDC (Markdown Component) standards and SDR&E (Systematic Documentation Review and Enhancement) processes.
*   **Self-Awareness:** KOIOS documentation includes self-critique, particularly in `KOIOS_documentation_audit_summary_20250518.md`, which highlights existing gaps and inconsistencies *within KOIOS itself* and across the broader EGOS documentation landscape. This audit is a critical input for the overall documentation unification project.
*   **Actions Taken (Initial):**
    *   Removed trailing signature from `KOS_description.md`.
*   **Findings & Notes (Preliminary):**
    *   KOIOS's own documentation is extensive and aims to be a model for EGOS standards.
    *   The subsystem's roadmap (`KOS_roadmap.md`) and its audit summary (`KOIOS_documentation_audit_summary_20250518.md`) explicitly identify areas for improvement within KOIOS documentation, including missing process documents.
    *   The audit summary also flags broader EGOS documentation issues, such as the `C:\Eva Guarani EGOS` path and the need for a canonical `MQP.md`.
    *   Given KOIOS's role, addressing its internal documentation consistency is a priority.
*   **Next Steps for KOIOS (Specific Plan):**
    1.  Further review key KOIOS documents for internal consistency (links, frontmatter) and adherence to its own defined standards.
    2.  Address issues highlighted in its own audit concerning KOIOS documentation before broader integration efforts.
    3.  Leverage `KOS_standards.md` and the audit summary as guiding documents for the overall EGOS documentation unification.
*   **Memory to be Created:** Detailed KOIOS subsystem capabilities, its role in documentation governance, and the importance of its self-audit.

### HARMONY Subsystem (Cross-Platform Compatibility and Integration Layer) - Review & Cleanup (2025-05-21)

*   **Status:** Active
*   **Path:** `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\HARMONY\`
*   **Reviewed Files:** `EGO_HRM_ROADMAP.md`, `HRM_cross_platform_compatibility.md`, `HRM_description.md`, `HRM_roadmap.md`.
*   **Key Capabilities:** Ensures EGOS components operate seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), hardware architectures, and software environments. Provides abstraction layers for OS-specific functionalities, manages dependencies, and handles platform-specific configurations. Includes a detailed framework for cross-platform compatibility considerations (filesystem, networking, UI, build processes).
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Removed trailing signatures from `EGO_HRM_ROADMAP.md`, `HRM_roadmap.md`, and `HRM_description.md`.
    *   Removed redundant YAML frontmatter sections from all four files.
    *   Adjusted relative links in `EGO_HRM_ROADMAP.md`, `HRM_roadmap.md`, and `HRM_description.md` to point to expected unified/project-level locations or valid local files.
*   **Findings & Notes:**
    *   `HRM_roadmap.md` appears to be the primary and most comprehensive roadmap for the subsystem.
    *   `EGO_HRM_ROADMAP.md` is largely a duplicate of `HRM_roadmap.md` and is a candidate for archival/deletion after user review to ensure no unique, valuable information is lost.
    *   `HRM_cross_platform_compatibility.md` is a key document detailing compatibility strategies.
*   **Memory to be Created:** HARMONY subsystem capabilities.

### ETHIK Subsystem (Ethical Tracking, Heightened Integrity, and Kindness) - Review & Cleanup (2025-05-21)

*   **Status:** Active
*   **Path:** `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ETHIK\`
*   **Reviewed Files:** `EGO_ETK_ROADMAP.md`, `ETK_api_reference.md`, `ETK_description.md`, `ETK_quick_reference.md`, `ETK_roadmap.md`, `ROADMAP.md` (local to ETHIK), `ethik_chain_implementation.md`.
*   **Key Capabilities:** Ethical validation, privacy protection, content validation, accessibility standards, EthikChain (auditable ethical validation), API for ethical checks.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Removed trailing signatures from all identified markdown files.
    *   Removed redundant YAML frontmatter from `EGO_ETK_ROADMAP.md` and `ETK_roadmap.md`.
    *   Adjusted relative links in `EGO_ETK_ROADMAP.md` and `ETK_roadmap.md` to point to expected unified/project-level locations or valid local files.
*   **Findings & Notes:**
    *   `ETK_roadmap.md` appears to be the primary and most comprehensive roadmap for the subsystem.
    *   `EGO_ETK_ROADMAP.md` and the local `ROADMAP.md` within the `ETHIK` directory are likely redundant and candidates for archival/deletion after user review. Content from these should be merged into `ETK_roadmap.md` if unique and valuable.
    *   The subsystem provides a foundational ethical framework for EGOS.
*   **Memory Created:** `MEMORY[c21e0093-0202-4b39-8932-64cee3cffcfd]` capturing ETHIK capabilities and documentation plan.

## Phase X+3: `docs/markdown` Directory Cleanup (Completed)

*   **Objective:** Remove the `docs/markdown` directory as it was found to contain only an empty `docs` subdirectory.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   **Step (Cascade - Handover Verification):** Verified that `c:\EGOS\docs\markdown\docs\` was empty (Steps 9, 11).
    *   **Step (Cascade - Deletion - Step IDs: b2e9a0d7-23ae-4961-91e3-a1ea18d6ff2c, ad0acf5a-a439-4b9b-b422-e2a21c74c8aa):** Moved `c:\EGOS\docs\markdown\docs\` to `c:\EGOS\_temp_delete_markdown_docs_\` and subsequently `c:\EGOS\docs\markdown\` to `c:\EGOS\_temp_delete_markdown_\`. This effectively clears the `docs/markdown` directory for eventual permanent deletion of the temp folders.
*   **Status:** `docs/markdown` directory cleanup is complete.

## Phase X: ATLAS Subsystem Documentation Consolidation & Integration

*   **Objective:** Consolidate and standardize documentation for the ATLAS subsystem and integrate it into the main project architecture document.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Renamed `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\ATL_description.md` to `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\README.md`. Updated its frontmatter for clarity (Purpose: "Systemic Cartography & Visualization") and revised its overview section. (Ref: Step ID 1980s)
    *   Deleted redundant roadmap files: `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\EGO_ATL_ROADMAP.md` and `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\ROADMAP.md`. (Ref: Step ID 1980s)
    *   Created `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\ATL_architecture.md` and populated it with architectural content previously located in `ATL_quick_reference.md`. This new file details components, diagrams, configuration, and dependencies. (Ref: Step ID 1989)
    *   Standardized frontmatter and updated references in `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\ATL_roadmap.md`, removing redundant frontmatter sections and ensuring consistency. (Ref: Step ID 2010)
    *   Attempted to clean up multiple redundant frontmatter sections in `c:\EGOS\docs\subsystems\ATLAS\ATL_quick_reference.md`. Due to persistent `edit_file` tool 
errors and the fact that its primary content was moved to `ATL_architecture.md`, the file was subsequently deleted. (Ref: Step IDs 2012-2019, 2021-2024)
    *   Added a dedicated ATLAS section to `C:\EGOS\ARCHITECTURE.MD`, summarizing its role, components, and linking to the detailed `ATL_architecture.md` and `README.md` in the ATLAS subsystem docs. (Ref: Step IDs 2026-2028)
*   **Outcome:** ATLAS documentation is now more consolidated, standardized, and integrated with the main project architecture. Key files include `docs/subsystems/ATLAS/README.md`, `ATL_roadmap.md`, and `ATL_architecture.md`.

## Phase X+1: `docs/process` Directory Cleanup & Log Consolidation

*   **Objective:** Streamline the `docs/process` directory by relocating its contents to more appropriate locations and consolidate process-related logs into the main `C:\EGOS\logs` directory.
*   **Actions Taken (`docs/process` Cleanup):**
    *   Identified `c:\EGOS\docs\process\reference_process_OLD_TO_DELETE\` and confirmed its deletion. (Ref: Steps 2040-2042, assumed successful deletion based on no error).
    *   Moved `c:\EGOS\docs\process\documentation_triggers.md` to `c:\EGOS\docs\governance\processes\documentation_triggers.md` after creating the destination directory. (Ref: Steps 2047-2053)
    *   Archived five dated log/summary files (e.g., `linter_error_resolution_log_20240814.md`, `project_review_summary_20240726.md`) from `c:\EGOS\docs\process\reference_process\` to a temporary archive path `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\process_logs\`. This involved creating the `c:\EGOS\archive\`, `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\`, and `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\process_logs\` directories. (Ref: Steps 2055-2070)
    *   Moved two validation procedure files (`PROC-VALIDATE-01_roadmap_tasks_validation.md`, `PROC-VALIDATE-02_subsystem_structure_validation.md`) from `c:\EGOS\docs\process\reference_process\validation\` to `c:\EGOS\docs\standards\validation_procedures\` after creating the destination directory. (Ref: Steps 2072-2076)
    *   Deleted the now-empty directories: `c:\EGOS\docs\process\reference_process\validation\`, `c:\EGOS\docs\process\reference_process\`, and `c:\EGOS\docs\process\`. (Ref: Step 2078, assumed successful deletion based on no error).
*   **Actions Taken (Log Consolidation - Correction & Finalization):**
    *   Recognized that logs should be consolidated under the root `C:\EGOS\logs\` directory instead of `C:\EGOS\archive\logs\`.
    *   Created `c:\EGOS\logs\process_activity\` as the new, standardized location for these process-related logs. (Ref: Steps 2080-2082)
    *   Moved the five previously archived log files from `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\process_logs\` to `c:\EGOS\logs\process_activity\`. (Ref: Steps 2084-2088)
    *   Deleted the now-empty temporary archive log directories: `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\process_logs\` and `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\`. (Ref: Step 2090, assumed successful deletion based on no error).
*   **Outcome:** The `docs/process` directory has been eliminated, and its contents are now organized into more logical locations under `docs/governance/processes`, `docs/standards/validation_procedures`, and `C:\EGOS\logs\process_activity`. This improves the clarity and maintainability of the documentation and log structure.

## Phase X+2: `docs/archived` Directory Consolidation

*   **Objective:** Consolidate archived materials from `c:\EGOS\docs\archived\` into the main `c:\EGOS\archive\` directory to centralize archived content.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Ensured `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\process_logs\` and `c:\EGOS\archive\logs\` were empty and confirmed their deletion (originally attempted in Step 2090, re-attempted and confirmed in Steps 2101-2103).
    *   Moved the contents of `c:\EGOS\docs\archived\` (subdirectories: `governance`, `reference`, `subsystems`) to their respective counterparts under `c:\EGOS\archive\` (e.g., `c:\EGOS\docs\archived\governance` to `c:\EGOS\archive\governance`). (Ref: Steps 2105-2107, all successful)
    *   Deleted the now-empty `c:\EGOS\docs\archived\` directory. (Ref: Step 2109, confirmed successful).
*   **Outcome:** The `docs/archived` directory has been eliminated. Its contents are now consolidated under `c:\EGOS\archive\`, leading to a cleaner top-level `docs` structure and a centralized archive.
