# üß† STRATEGIC_THINKING Repository

This directory houses materials related to strategic analysis, decision-making processes, and long-term planning for the EGOS project.

## Purpose

The goal is to maintain a structured record of:

*   **Meta-Prompts:** Structured prompts used to guide AI models (like Gemini or Claude) in performing complex strategic analyses.
*   **AI-Generated Analyses:** The outputs produced by AI based on the meta-prompts (e.g., market analyses, competitive landscapes, risk assessments, architectural proposals).
*   **Supporting Research Links:** URLs or references to external articles, studies, or data sources used during the analysis.
*   **Human Review & Synthesis:** Notes or summaries reflecting human interpretation and conclusions drawn from the AI analyses.

## Structure

Files are typically organized by topic or analysis date, often prefixed with the AI model used and the date.

## Relation to Other Documents

*   Insights generated here often inform the main project **[STRATEGY](STRATEGY.md)**.
*   Specific actionable tasks derived from these analyses are added to the **[ROADMAP](../../governance/migrations/processed/pt/ROADMAP.md)**.
*   The process for conducting strategic analysis using AI is guided by **[strategic_analysis_workflow](../../reference/strategic_analysis_workflow.mdc)**.
