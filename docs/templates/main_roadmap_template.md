## Roadmap Governance

### Roadmap Hierarchy

This main roadmap contains high-level epics that are broken down into specific tasks in local roadmaps. For detailed implementation tasks, refer to the corresponding local roadmap files:

- [Scripts Roadmap](scripts/roadmap.md)
- [Documentation Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
- [Subsystems Roadmap](subsystems/roadmap.md)

### Status Synchronization

Epic statuses in this main roadmap are synchronized with their child tasks in local roadmaps according to the following rules:

1. An epic is marked "Done" only when all its child tasks are complete
2. An epic is "Blocked" if any critical child task is blocked
3. An epic is "In Progress" when at least one child task is in progress

For more details on roadmap hierarchy and status synchronization, see [Roadmap Hierarchy Guidelines](docs/governance/roadmap_hierarchy.md).
