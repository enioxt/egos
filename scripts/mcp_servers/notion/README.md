# Notion MCP Integration

## Overview

This integration connects the EGOS ecosystem with Notion using the official [Notion MCP Server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server). This allows AI assistants like Claude and Cascade to interact with Notion pages, databases, and comments directly through the MCP protocol.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) 
2. Create a new **internal** integration
3. Copy the integration token (begins with `ntn_`)
4. Configure capabilities as needed (recommended: start with "Read content" only for testing)

### 2. Connect Notion Content to Your Integration

For any page or database you want to make accessible:
1. Open the page in Notion
2. Click on the "..." menu at the top right
3. Select "Add connections"
4. Choose your integration from the list

### 3. Add Notion MCP to EGOS Configuration

Update your `mcp_config.json` file to include the Notion MCP server configuration:

```json
"notionApi": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
  "env": {
    "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_INTEGRATION_TOKEN\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\" }"
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` with your actual Notion integration token.

## Security Considerations

* Keep your integration token secure - never commit it to version control
* Consider using read-only permissions when possible
* Create separate integrations for different purposes/security levels
* Review the pages and databases connected to your integration regularly

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands

```
Get all pages in database 123456789
```

```
Create a new page titled "Meeting Notes" in database 123456789
```

```
Add a comment "This needs revision" to block 987654321
```

## Implementation Notes

* The Notion MCP server implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/)
* This integration follows the EGOS Centralization Protocol for adding new components
* The current implementation focuses on basic read/write operations through Notion's API

## Alignment with EGOS Principles

* **Universal Accessibility**: Enhances accessibility by connecting knowledge bases across platforms
* **Conscious Modularity**: Properly abstracted as an MCP server with standard interfaces
* **Reciprocal Trust**: Authorization and permission model ensures user control over data access

## Future Enhancements

* Create dedicated Python wrapper for common Notion operations
* Implement templates for standardized Notion database interactions
* Develop synchronization between EGOS documentation and Notion knowledge bases
