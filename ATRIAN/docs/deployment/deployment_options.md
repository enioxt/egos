## 3. Self-Hosted Deployment (Docker)

### 3.1 Overview

The Docker deployment model allows organizations to run ATRiAN within their own infrastructure while benefiting from containerization for easier setup and management. This option offers maximum control over data and configuration.

### 3.2 System Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements

- **CPU**: 4 cores (8 recommended)
- **RAM**: 8GB (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 20GB SSD (50GB recommended)
- **Operating System**: Any Docker-compatible OS (Linux preferred)
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or later
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.0 or later

#### Recommended for Production

- **CPU**: 8+ cores
- **RAM**: 16GB+
- **Storage**: 100GB+ SSD
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or equivalent
- **Network**: 100Mbps dedicated connection
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana setup
- **Backup**: Daily automated backups

### 3.3 Installation Process

#### 3.3.1 Prerequisites

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your target system
2. Clone the ATRiAN repository or download the distribution package
3. Prepare SSL certificates if deploying with HTTPS
4. Ensure network access to required ports
5. Prepare environment configuration file

#### 3.3.2 Basic Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/egos-system/atrian-eaas.git
cd atrian-eaas

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Configure settings

# Start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

#### 3.3.3 Configuration Options

The `.env` file supports the following key configurations:

```
# Server configuration
ATRIAN_PORT=8000
ATRIAN_WORKERS=4
ATRIAN_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Database configuration
DB_TYPE=postgresql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=atrian
DB_USER=atrian
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Framework configuration
DEFAULT_FRAMEWORKS=utilitarian,ai_ethics
CUSTOM_FRAMEWORKS_PATH=/app/custom_frameworks

# Security settings
API_KEY_REQUIRED=true
API_KEY_HEADER=X-API-Key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
```

#### 3.3.4 Post-Installation Steps

1. Create an administrator account
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec atrian python -m scripts.create_admin
   ```

2. Load additional ethical frameworks
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec atrian python -m scripts.load_frameworks
   ```

3. Run initial system tests
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec atrian python -m scripts.test_system
   ```

### 3.4 Updates and Maintenance

#### Updating ATRiAN

```bash
# Pull the latest changes
git pull

# Rebuild and restart containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations if needed
docker-compose exec atrian python -m scripts.migrate
```

#### Backup and Restore

```bash
# Backup database and configurations
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U atrian atrian > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
cp .env .env.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Restore from backup
cat backup_20250101.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U atrian atrian
```

### 3.5 Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**:
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy
   - Use HTTPS with valid certificates
   - Implement network-level access controls

2. **Authentication**:
   - Enable API key authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use strong passwords for administrative accounts

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement database access controls
   - Set up regular security audits

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Configure comprehensive logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review logs

### 3.6 Performance Monitoring

Based on the ATRiAN performance monitoring standards, set up the following:

#### 3.6.1 Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Response Time**:
  - Read-only endpoints: Target <500ms, Acceptable <1000ms, Critical >2000ms
  - Write endpoints: Target <1000ms, Acceptable <2000ms, Critical >4000ms
  - Complex queries: Target <2000ms, Acceptable <4000ms, Critical >8000ms

- **Success Rate**: Target 99.5% or higher

- **Resource Utilization**:
  - CPU: <70% sustained utilization
  - Memory: <80% utilization
  - Disk: <80% capacity

#### 3.6.2 Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Install monitoring stack (if not already available)
git clone https://github.com/egos-system/atrian-monitoring.git
cd atrian-monitoring

# Configure monitoring
cp prometheus.yml.example prometheus.yml
