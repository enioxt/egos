# Work Title: MCP Documentation Standardization Progress

**Date:** 2025-05-25
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Roadmap IDs:** MCP-DOC-STD-01, MCP-BRIEF-DIAGENIO

## 1. Objective

To standardize all MCP Product Briefs according to the `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md`, consolidate prompt-related folders, and ensure all documentation follows established EGOS standards.

## 2. Context

Following the completion of the `CRONOS-VersionControl_Product_Brief.md` (documented in `WORK_2025-05-25_CRONOS_Product_Brief_Completion_And_Documentation_Updates.md`), we have continued the standardization process for other MCP Product Briefs. This work log documents the progress made with folder consolidation and the standardization of additional MCP Product Briefs.

## 3. Completed Tasks

### 3.1 Folder Consolidation
- ‚úÖ Moved `generate_python_docstring.yaml` from `meta_prompts` to `prompts` directory.
- ‚úÖ Analyzed two versions of strategic analysis prompt:
  - `C:\EGOS\docs\prompts\strategic_analysis_prompt_v2.0.md`
  - `C:\EGOS\docs\prompts\strategic_analysis_prompt_v2.0_from_meta.md`
- ‚úÖ Renamed `strategic_analysis_prompt_v2.0_from_meta.md` to `strategic_analysis_prompt_v2.1.md` as it is the more advanced version.
- ‚úÖ Identified folders for manual deletion:
  - `C:\EGOS\docs\meta_prompts\` (empty folder)
  - `C:\EGOS\docs\prompts\pdds\` (empty folder)
  - `C:\EGOS\docs\prompts\strategic_analysis_prompt_v2.0.md` (redundant file)

### 3.2 MCP Product Brief Standardization
