# HANDOVER PACKAGE — Relation Extraction Service v0.2 (spaCy-powered)

*Date:* 2025-06-15  
*Author:* Cascade on behalf of enioxt  
*Related Workstreams:* ATRiAN Analytics ➜ Neural Relation Extraction  
*Version:* 0.2  

---
## 1. Executive Summary
The Relation Extraction micro-service has been elevated from a stub to a functional FastAPI service backed by **spaCy `en_core_web_trf`**.  All unit & integration tests now pass (`pytest -q ➜ 4/4 GREEN`).  Documentation, tests, and project metadata have been synchronised and cross-referenced with EGOS global standards.

## 2. Delivered Assets
| Area | Details | Files / References |
|------|---------|--------------------|
| **Service Code** | Model loading via FastAPI *lifespan* event; basic entity–pair extraction, health endpoint, error handling. | `services/relation_extraction/service.py` |
| **Schemas** | `TextRequest`, `ExtractionResponse`, `Relation`. | `services/relation_extraction/schemas.py` |
| **Tests** | 4 pytest cases validating health, empty input, extraction, schema integrity. | `tests/test_relation_service.py` |
| **Package Init** | Added missing init file. | `services/__init__.py` |
| **CI Evidence** | All tests pass locally. | Terminal run 2025-06-15 13:11 BR-03 |
| **Docs Updated** | Implementation plan, README features table. | `docs/implementation_plans/relation_extraction_service_plan.md`, `README.md` |
| **Worklog** | Backlog & priorities recorded. | `~/.codeium/windsurf/brain/<session>/plan.md` |

## 3. Technical Walk-through
1. **Model Lifecycle**  
   ```python
   @asynccontextmanager
   async def lifespan(app):
       ... nlp_model = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf")
   ```
   This ensures a single transformer instance for the app lifetime.

2. **Extraction Logic**  
   Sequential entity pairing generates `Relation` objects with a placeholder `related_to` label and constant confidence `0.5`.

3. **Error Handling**  
   *503 Service Unavailable* returned when the model is missing; *400 Bad Request* for empty input.  Detailed logging added for model-loading exceptions.

4. **Testing Fixture Fix**  
   Lifespan events were not firing reliably.  A **pytest fixture** now wraps `TestClient` in a context-manager, guaranteeing startup/shutdown per test module.

---
## 4. Verification Matrix
| Scenario | Expected | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Health endpoint after startup | `{"status":"ok"}` | ✅ Pass |
| /extract with empty list | HTTP 400 | ✅ Pass |
| /extract with sample entity sentence | HTTP 200 & ≥ 1 relations | ✅ Pass |
| /extract when model missing | HTTP 503 (placeholder test) | ⚠️ Deferred (requires mocking) |

## 5. Backlog / Next Steps
1. **Dataset Conversion** – MITRE CRE ➜ `.spacy` (scripts + docs).  
2. **Fine-Tuning** – create `projects/relation_extraction/config.cfg`, train typed-relation model.  
3. **Endpoint Enhancement** – emit typed relations & confidences from fine-tuned model.  
4. **Dashboard Integration** – render graph view in Streamlit dashboard.  
5. **Performance/CI** – cache transformer weights; optionally switch to `en_core_web_sm` for unit tests.

Tracked in `plan.md` under *Relation Extraction Service Workstream*.

## 6. Cross-References
* `.windsurfrules` Global Rules — ensures alignment with MQP.  
* **Workflows:**  
  * `/iterative_code_refinement_cycle` — employ for future refactors/perf tuning.  
  * `/cross_reference_maintenance` — run nightly to keep docs graph healthy.  
  * `/dynamic_documentation_update_from_code_changes` — auto-sync docs after commits.  
  * `/distill_and_vault_prompt` — distil chat → PDD for reusable prompts (e.g., spaCy fine-tune assistant).  
  * `/project_handover_procedure` — template & checklist used for this document.
* **Standards:**  
  * `KOIOS_PDD_Standard.md` — for forthcoming prompt assets.  
  * `handover_checklist_template.md` — checklist basis (see Annex A).
