# CORUJA-MYCELIUM: Performance Analysis Plan

## Objective

Analyze current performance bottlenecks in the CORUJA-MYCELIUM integration and implement optimizations to reduce latency from the current 5-8 seconds to a target of 2-4 seconds for reasoning operations.

## Baseline Measurement

Before implementing any optimizations, we need to establish a performance baseline:

1. **Metrics to Capture**:
   - End-to-end latency for reasoning requests
   - Message serialization/deserialization time
   - Network transmission time
   - Message processing time
   - Redis operation time
   - Circuit breaker overhead

2. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Single reasoning request
   - Concurrent reasoning requests (5, 10, 20)
   - Large payload reasoning requests
   - Continuous operation (100 requests over time)

3. **Measurement Tools**:
   - Create timing decorators for key methods
   - Add structured logging with timing information
   - Implement PerformanceMetrics class as described in the enhancement plan

## Performance Analysis Areas

### 1. Connection Management

**Current Implementation**:
- New connections possibly created for each request
- Potential connection setup/teardown overhead

**Analysis Tasks**:
- Measure connection establishment time
- Track connection reuse patterns
- Analyze connection failures and recovery time

### 2. Serialization/Deserialization

**Current Implementation**:
- Likely using default Pydantic serialization
- Potential overhead for large payloads

**Analysis Tasks**:
- Profile serialization/deserialization time for different payload sizes
- Identify frequently serialized objects
- Compare with alternative serialization methods

### 3. Request/Response Cycle

**Current Implementation**:
- Request sent to MYCELIUM, then wait for response
- Potential inefficiencies in response handling

**Analysis Tasks**:
- Measure time spent waiting for responses
- Analyze handler registration/deregistration overhead
- Identify opportunities for parallel processing

### 4. Circuit Breaker Impact

**Current Implementation**:
- Circuit breaker adds overhead to requests
- Lock management could impact concurrent requests

**Analysis Tasks**:
- Measure circuit breaker execution overhead
- Analyze lock contention under load
- Evaluate lock strategy improvements

## Potential Optimizations

Based on initial code review, these optimizations may improve performance:

1. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Implement connection pooling to reuse connections
   - Pre-establish connections during initialization
   - Lazy reconnection strategies

2. **Serialization Optimization**:
   - Use orjson for faster JSON serialization
   - Consider binary serialization for large payloads
   - Optimize schema validation for frequently used types

3. **Request Batching**:
   - Implement request batching for scenarios with multiple similar requests
   - Aggregate responses where appropriate

4. **Caching Layer**:
   - Implement response caching for frequently requested reasoning patterns
   - Tunable cache with TTL and size limits
   - Consider distributed caching with Redis

5. **Protocol Optimization**:
   - Evaluate if Redis PubSub is the most efficient mechanism
   - Consider direct Redis commands where appropriate
   - Explore Redis Streams for high-throughput scenarios

6. **Concurrency Improvements**:
   - Review lock usage in circuit breaker
   - Consider more granular locking strategies
   - Evaluate asyncio optimizations (task grouping, etc.)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Instrumentation & Baseline
- Add performance metrics collection
- Establish baseline performance
- Create visualization for metrics
- Document bottlenecks

### Phase 2: High-Impact Optimizations
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize serialization
- Enhance circuit breaker efficiency

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations
- Implement request batching
- Add caching layer
- Optimize protocol usage

## Success Criteria

The optimizations will be considered successful if they:

1. Reduce average latency from 5-8s to 2-4s for reasoning operations
2. Support at least 100 requests per minute per node
3. Maintain or improve reliability metrics
4. Do not introduce regression in functionality

## Testing Strategy

All optimizations will be validated with:

1. Unit tests comparing performance before and after changes
2. Integration tests measuring end-to-end performance
3. Stress tests evaluating behavior under high load
4. Long-running tests ensuring stability over time

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Optimizations may introduce subtle bugs
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing suite with high coverage

2. **Risk**: Performance improvements may vary across environments
   - **Mitigation**: Test in multiple environments and document variability

3. **Risk**: Caching may lead to stale data
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper cache invalidation and configurable TTL

4. **Risk**: Increased complexity may reduce maintainability
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and abstraction of complex optimizations
