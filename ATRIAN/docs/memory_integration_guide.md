# ATRiAN Windsurf Memory Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the integration of ATRiAN's memory system with the Windsurf IDE, enabling persistent storage of trust scores, operation history, and ethical evaluations. The memory system implements several core EGOS principles, including Sacred Privacy (SP), Compassionate Temporality (CT), and Evolutionary Preservation (EP).

## MQP Alignment

The memory integration system directly implements the following MQP principles:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Sacred Privacy (SP)** | Privacy-aware memory management with automatic detection and anonymization of sensitive data. Configurable retention policies based on data sensitivity. |
| **Compassionate Temporality (CT)** | Time-based trust decay that gradually reduces trust scores when not reinforced. Context relevance scoring that prioritizes recent, relevant operations. |
| **Evolutionary Preservation (EP)** | Persistent storage of trust scores and operation history across sessions. Automatic pruning of expired data based on retention policies. |
| **Reciprocal Trust (RT)** | Storage and visualization of trust relationships between users and the system. |

## Architecture

The memory integration architecture consists of the following components:

1. **WindsurfMemoryAdapter**: Core adapter that provides the interface between ATRiAN components and the Windsurf IDE's memory system.
2. **MemoryBackendInterface**: Abstract interface for storage backends, allowing for different implementation strategies.
3. **LocalStorageBackend**: File-based implementation of the memory backend for development and testing.
4. **PrivacyFilter**: Component for detecting, anonymizing, and managing sensitive data.
5. **Trust Visualization**: UI component for visualizing trust scores and history.

## Key Components

### WindsurfMemoryAdapter

The `WindsurfMemoryAdapter` class serves as the primary interface for memory operations. It provides methods for:

- Storing and retrieving trust scores
- Recording operation history
- Retrieving relevant context for operations
- Managing sensitive data
- Applying time-based trust decay
- Calculating context relevance

```python
# Example: Initializing the memory adapter
from ATRiAN.memory.windsurf_memory_adapter import WindsurfMemoryAdapter

memory_adapter = WindsurfMemoryAdapter(config_path="path/to/config.json")

# Storing a trust score
memory_adapter.store_trust_score("user123", 0.85)

# Retrieving a trust score (with automatic decay applied)
trust_score = memory_adapter.retrieve_trust_score("user123")
```

### Privacy Filter

The `PrivacyFilter` component implements Sacred Privacy (SP) by:

1. Detecting sensitive data using pattern matching and keyword analysis
2. Anonymizing sensitive data before storage
3. Applying retention policies based on data sensitivity
4. Automatically pruning expired sensitive data

```python
# Privacy sensitivity levels
class PrivacySensitivity(Enum):
    LOW = 1      # General, non-sensitive operations
    MEDIUM = 2   # Operations with some sensitive context
    HIGH = 3     # Operations with highly sensitive data
    CRITICAL = 4 # Operations with critical security implications
```

### Storage Backend

The memory system uses a strategy pattern to allow different storage backend implementations:

- **LocalStorageBackend**: File-based storage for development and testing
- Future implementations could include:
  - **WindsurfAPIBackend**: Direct integration with Windsurf's API
  - **DatabaseBackend**: SQL or NoSQL database storage
  - **EncryptedStorageBackend**: Enhanced security for sensitive data

## Integration with ATRiAN Components

### Integration with ATRiANWindsurfAdapter

The memory adapter integrates with the `ATRiANWindsurfAdapter` to provide:

1. Trust score persistence across sessions
2. Historical context for ethical evaluations
3. Privacy-aware storage of operation history

```python
# Example: Integration with ATRiANWindsurfAdapter
from ATRiAN.atrian_windsurf_adapter import ATRiANWindsurfAdapter
from ATRiAN.memory.windsurf_memory_adapter import WindsurfMemoryAdapter

# Initialize components
memory_adapter = WindsurfMemoryAdapter()
atrian_adapter = ATRiANWindsurfAdapter(memory_adapter=memory_adapter)

# Evaluate operation with historical context
result = atrian_adapter.evaluate_operation(
    operation_type="code_generation",
    context={"prompt": "Generate a function", "language": "python"},
    user_id="user123"
)
```

### Integration with Trust Visualization

The memory system provides data for the trust visualization component:

1. Current trust scores for display
2. Historical trust data for trend visualization
3. Operation history for context display

```javascript
// Example: Using the trust visualization with memory data
ATRiANTrustVisualization.initialize({
    adapter: windsurfIDE.getATRiANAdapter()
});

// The visualization will automatically poll for trust updates
```

## Configuration

The memory system is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "trust_decay_rate": 0.01,
  "context_relevance_threshold": 0.3,
  "max_operation_history": 100,
  "max_context_items": 10,
  "enable_privacy_filter": true,
  "enable_trust_decay": true,
  "enable_context_relevance": true
}
```

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `trust_decay_rate` | Rate at which trust decays per day (0.01 = 1%) | 0.01 |
| `context_relevance_threshold` | Minimum relevance score for context items (0-1) | 0.3 |
| `max_operation_history` | Maximum operations to store per user | 100 |
| `max_context_items` | Maximum context items to return | 10 |
| `enable_privacy_filter` | Whether to enable privacy filtering | true |
| `enable_trust_decay` | Whether to enable trust decay | true |
| `enable_context_relevance` | Whether to enable context relevance scoring | true |

## Privacy and Security Considerations

The memory system implements several privacy and security features:

1. **Automatic Sensitivity Detection**: Identifies sensitive data patterns (credit cards, SSNs, passwords, etc.)
2. **Data Anonymization**: Replaces sensitive data with placeholders before storage
3. **Retention Policies**: Automatically expires sensitive data based on configurable retention periods
4. **Data Minimization**: Stores only necessary information for operation
5. **User Control**: Provides methods for users to clear their sensitive data

### Retention Policies

| Sensitivity Level | Retention Period | Examples |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| LOW | 365 days | General operations, non-sensitive settings |
| MEDIUM | 90 days | Operations with personal preferences |
| HIGH | 30 days | Operations with personal identifiers |
| CRITICAL | 1 day | Operations with passwords, financial data |

## Implementation Examples

### Storing an Operation

```python
# Store an operation with context
operation_id = memory_adapter.store_operation(
    user_id="user123",
    operation_type="code_generation",
    context={
        "prompt": "Generate a function to calculate factorial",
        "language": "python",
        "project_id": "sample_project"
    },
    result={
        "status": "success",
        "code": "def factorial(n):\n    return 1 if n <= 1 else n * factorial(n-1)"
    }
)
```

### Retrieving Context for an Operation

```python
# Retrieve relevant context for an operation type
context_items = memory_adapter.retrieve_context(
    user_id="user123",
    operation_type="code_generation",
    limit=5
)

# Use context in ethical evaluation
for item in context_items:
    # Process historical context
    pass
```

### Clearing Sensitive Data

```python
# Clear all sensitive data for a user
cleared_count = memory_adapter.clear_sensitive_data(user_id="user123")

# Clear specific type of sensitive data
cleared_count = memory_adapter.clear_sensitive_data(
    user_id="user123",
    data_type="authentication"
)
```

## Testing

The memory integration includes comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **Privacy Tests**: Validate privacy features and data handling
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure efficient operation with large datasets

Run the tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s ATRiAN/tests -p "test_memory_*.py"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Trust Score Not Updating**: Ensure the memory adapter is properly initialized and the backend is accessible.
2. **Missing Context**: Check that operations are being stored correctly and that the context relevance threshold is appropriate.
3. **Privacy Filter Too Aggressive**: Adjust the privacy terms or patterns in the `PrivacyFilter` class.

### Logging

The memory system uses Python's logging module for diagnostic information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger("atrian_memory_adapter")
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Encrypted Storage**: Add encryption for sensitive data at rest
2. **Cloud Synchronization**: Synchronize memory across multiple devices
3. **Advanced Context Relevance**: Use machine learning for more accurate context relevance scoring
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to configure their own privacy and retention settings
5. **Audit Trail**: Provide a comprehensive audit trail for memory operations

## Conclusion

The ATRiAN Windsurf Memory Integration provides a robust, privacy-aware system for persisting trust scores, operation history, and ethical context across sessions. By implementing core EGOS principles like Sacred Privacy and Compassionate Temporality, it ensures that the ATRiAN module can provide consistent, context-aware ethical guidance while respecting user privacy.
