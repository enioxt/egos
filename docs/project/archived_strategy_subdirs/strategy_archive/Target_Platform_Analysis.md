# Target Platform Analysis

**Status:** Placeholder
**Target Completion:** Q3 2025

*This document will analyze the trade-offs and recommend the initial target platform(s) for delivering EGOS functionality to end-users.*

## Platforms Considered

*   Web Application (React? Vue? Other?)
*   Desktop Application (Electron? Tauri? Native? - Windows/Linux/Mac)
*   Mobile Application (Native Android/iOS? Cross-Platform like React Native/Flutter?)
*   Developer SDK (Python? Other languages?)
*   Standalone CLI Tool
*   IDE Integration (e.g., VS Code Extension beyond Cursor)

## Evaluation Criteria

*   Reach for Target Audience(s)
*   Development Complexity & Time
*   User Experience Requirements
*   Integration Capabilities (with subsystems, Mycelium, external tools)
*   Maintenance Overhead
*   Monetization Model Fit
*   Performance Needs

## Recommendation

*(To be determined based on analysis)*
