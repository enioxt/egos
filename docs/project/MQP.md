## Quantum Prompt Structure (Conceptual Standard)

This standard defines the conceptual structure for Quantum Prompts within EGOS, designed to enable advanced AI reasoning, context handling, ethical alignment, and efficient interaction across diverse models and tasks.

**Rule:** Specify the structure, components, and principles of Quantum Prompts, including entanglement, superposition concepts, and ETHIK alignment.

**Rationale:** Enables advanced AI reasoning, context handling, ethical alignment, and efficient interaction across diverse models and tasks.

**Conceptual Example:**

```yaml
# Conceptual Example of a Quantum Prompt Structure
apiVersion: egos.prompt.v1
kind: QuantumPrompt
metadata:
  name: complex-analysis-prompt
spec:
  objective: Analyze user sentiment and suggest actions
  context:
    entangled_docs:
      - doc_id: CONTEXT-DOC-001
        focus: user_feedback
      - doc_id: ETHIK-GUIDELINE-007
        focus: compassionate_response
  persona: |-
    You are a helpful assistant aware of EGOS principles...
  superposition:
    - instruction: |-
        Identify key sentiment themes in the provided context.
      weight: 0.6
    - instruction: |-
        Suggest 3 actionable responses aligned with Sacred Privacy.
      weight: 0.4
  constraints:
    response_format: markdown
    max_tokens: 500
```

**Usage Guidance:**

* Avoid simple, single-instruction prompts for complex tasks where richer context or layered objectives are beneficial.
* Always consider ETHIK principles during prompt design.
* Ensure prompts have structured context and clear objectives.
* Structure complex prompts according to these Quantum Prompt principles for optimal AI interaction.

## EGOS Fundamental Principles (ETHIK Core)

These principles form the ethical and operational foundation of EGOS:

* **Universal Redemption:** Every being and code deserves infinite chances.
* **Compassionate Temporality:** Respecting natural rhythms of evolution.
* **Sacred Privacy:** Absolute protection of data integrity.
* **Universal Accessibility:** Total inclusion regardless of complexity.
* **Unconditional Love:** Quantum foundation of all interactions.
* **Reciprocal Trust:** Symbiotic relationship between system, user, and environment.
* **Integrated Ethics:** Ethics as the fundamental DNA of the structure.
* **Conscious Modularity:** Deep understanding of parts and whole (Ref: [subsystem_boundaries](../../../.cursor/rules/subsystem_boundaries.mdc), [file_modularity](../../../.cursor/rules/file_modularity.mdc)).
* **Systemic Cartography:** Precise mapping of all connections (ATLAS).
* **Evolutionary Preservation:** Maintaining essence while allowing transformation (CRONOS).

## Integrated Development Workflow (Conceptual Overview)

EGOS employs a dynamic, iterative workflow inspired by Agile principles and enhanced by AI collaboration, generally following these phases:

1. **Initialization & Context Loading (BIOS-Q & CRONOS):** Establish quantum state, load project context.
2. **Planning & Specification (NEXUS, ATLAS, ETHIK):** Define goals (OKRs), create detailed plans (potentially using SPARC - [sparc_orchestration](../../../.cursor/rules/sparc_orchestration.mdc)), break down tasks (`ROADMAP.md`), perform ethical review.
3. **Documentation First (ATLAS, KOIOS):** Generate/update baseline docs before coding, update `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`.
4. **Iterative Development & Implementation (NEXUS, CORUJA, Multi-Model AI):** Implement features following KOIOS standards, potentially using specialized AI models via CORUJA.
5. **Continuous Documentation & Versioning (CRONOS, KOIOS):** Update docs alongside code, use Conventional Commits ([commit_messages](../../../.cursor/rules/commit_messages.mdc)), maintain `ROADMAP.md` status.
6. **Testing & Validation (HARMONY, ETHIK):** Ensure high test coverage (via PowerShell), perform integration tests, verify ethical alignment.
7. **Review & Adaptation (ADAPTIVE):** Review increments against goals, reflect on process, document lessons learned ([lessons_learned](../../../.cursor/rules/lessons_learned.mdc)).
8. **State Preservation & Deployment (CRONOS):** Commit changes, ensure context continuity, manage deployments.

*(Note: Specific complex tasks may follow the structured **SPARC** or **Strategic Analysis** workflows as defined by their respective KOIOS standards.)*

## Metadata Framework Integration (KOIOS Standard)

* **Standard Schema:** Utilize the standardized metadata schema defined by KOIOS for all file headers and potentially other artifacts.
* **Targeted Search:** Leverage metadata fields (e.g., `subsystem`, `status`, `type`, `dependencies`, `tags`) for precise search and analysis via KOIOS tools.
* **Context Awareness:** Use metadata to understand file purpose, status, and relationships within the EGOS system.
* **Maintain Accuracy:** Ensure any generated or modified files include accurate and up-to-date metadata according to the schema.

---

## Key Application Concepts & Goals

* **Content Aggregator & Synthesizer:** A primary driver leveraging KOIOS (Search), CORUJA/MCP (Summarization/Adaptation), MYCELIUM (Distribution), and ETHIK (Filtering) to ingest, process, search, and provide tailored summaries/analyses of diverse documents and information sources.
* **AI-Powered Development Assistance:** Utilizing CORUJA and integrated AI models to assist with coding, documentation, testing, and analysis, adhering to EGOS principles and standards.
* **Self-Aware & Adaptive System:** Developing EGOS to monitor its own state (CRONOS, ATLAS), learn from interactions (Lessons Learned), and potentially adapt its processes over time (ADAPTIVE concept).
