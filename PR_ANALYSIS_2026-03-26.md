## PR #6: Agent Message Signature Contract + Stitch UI + Codex Doctor

### Status
- **State**: Open (was dirty, now resolved)
- **Commits**: 1
- **Changes**: +923, -40 (16 files)
- **CI**: GitGuardian ✅ Pass, CodeRabbit (in progress)
- **Merge conflicts**: ✅ RESOLVED

### What It Does
- Adds mandatory signature contract for operational messages (`.guarani/standards/AGENT_MESSAGE_SIGNATURE_CONTRACT.md`)
- Introduces Stitch-first UI workflow (`.windsurf/workflows/stitch.md`)
- Adds two new agents: `aiox_gem_hunter` and `gtm_harvester`
- Adds `doctor:codex` command to validate environment
- Updates governance triggers (v1.2.0)

### Improvements Made
✅ Resolved merge conflicts in:
- `triggers.json` (kept Stitch + EGOS activation triggers)
- `.windsurfrules` (added Stitch-first + Codex disclosure rules)
- `package.json` (merged all scripts)
- `AGENTS.md` (combined Codex constraints + Slash workflows)

### Next Steps
- Wait for CodeRabbit review to complete
- Review and approve
- Merge when ready

## PR #5: Dependabot Security Update

### Status
- **State**: Open
- **Changes**: dependency bump (picomatch 2.3.1→2.3.2)
- **CI**: GitGuardian ✅, Validate ❌ (exit 128 - Git error)

### Issue
Frozen zones check failing with exit code 128 (Git repository error).

### Recommendation
🚫 **Defer** — This is a dependency-only PR and the CI error needs investigation. Not blocking any features. Can be reviewed after strategic PRs (#6, #4, #2) are merged.

## PR #4: Canonical Workflows + PR Tooling + EGOS Activation Meta-Prompt

### Status
- **State**: Open since 2026-03-25
- **Base**: `main` (sha: f790db4d...)
- **Files**: Multiple governance, documentation, and tool additions

### Key Additions
- Canonical workflow documents (`.agents/workflows/`)
- PR infrastructure: template, pack generator, gate scripts
- Activation meta-prompt + governance documentation
- New npm scripts: `pr:pack`, `pr:gate`, `pr:audit`

### Assessment
- ✅ Well-structured governance enhancement
- ✅ Complements PR #6 (signature contract)
- ⚠️ Awaiting review + possible CodeRabbit feedback

### Improvements Needed
1. Ensure all new scripts have proper error handling
2. Verify governance-sync propagation after merge
3. Add examples to workflow docs for clarity

## PR #2: /start and /pr Workflows + PR Pack Generator

### Status
- **State**: Open since 2026-03-24
- **Base**: older (sha: 7a29f6d...)
- **Files**: 12 files modified/added

### File Comparison: PR #2 vs PR #4
| File | PR #2 | PR #4 | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| `.agents/workflows/start-workflow.md` | ✅ | ✅ | Both have it |
| `.agents/workflows/pr-prep.md` | ✅ | ✅ | Both have it |
| `.agents/workflows/disseminate.md` | ✅ | ✅ | Both have it |
| `.agents/workflows/mycelium.md` | ❌ | ✅ | **PR #4 only** |
| `.guarani/prompts/meta/egos-activation-governance.md` | ❌ | ✅ | **PR #4 only** |
| `scripts/pr-ecosystem-audit.ts` | ❌ | ✅ | **PR #4 only** |
| triggers.json v1.2.0 with activation trigger | ❌ | ✅ | **PR #4 only** |

### Verdict
**PR #2 is SUPERSEDED by PR #4**. PR #4 adds:
1. `/mycelium` workflow for cross-repo mesh auditing
2. EGOS activation meta-prompt with evidence-first contract
3. PR ecosystem audit script for GitHub owner scanning

### Recommendation
✅ **Close PR #2** with explanation that PR #4 is the canonical version and includes all changes plus additional governance improvements.

**Close comment**: "This PR has been superseded by #4, which includes all changes from #2 plus additional governance automation (mycelium workflow, activation meta-prompt, and ecosystem audit tooling). Closing in favor of #4."

## Consolidated Improvement Plan

### Immediate (Next 30 min)
1. ✅ PR #6: Conflicts resolved, ready for review
2. 🔍 PR #4 & #2: Clarify which one is canonical → merge the better one
3. ❌ PR #5: Defer pending CI investigation

### Short Term (Next 2 hours)
1. Wait for CodeRabbit review completion on PR #6
2. Merge PR #6 (has highest strategic value)
3. Review PR #4 thoroughly for governance correctness
4. Merge PR #4 if approved
5. If PR #2 is redundant, close with explanation; otherwise integrate

### Validation Before Merge
All PRs must pass:
- `bun typecheck`
- `bun test`
- `bun governance:check` (should return 0 drift)
- CodeRabbit automated review (no critical blockers)

---

## Known Issues

### PR #5 CI Failure
- **Error**: Frozen zones check (exit 128)
- **Cause**: Git repository error (possibly authentication or config)
- **Impact**: Blocks merge of dependabot PR
- **Action**: Investigate pre-commit hook behavior or GitHub Actions context

### Version Conflicts
- PR #6 updated `triggers.json` to v1.2.0
- PR #4 also manages triggers.json versioning
- **Resolution**: Merge PR #6 first, then rebase PR #4 to avoid conflicts
