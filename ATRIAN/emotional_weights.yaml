# EGOS System - ATRiAN Module: Emotional Weights Configuration
# Version: 1.0
# Last Modified: {{ CURRENT_DATE_TIME_ISO }}
# 
# Purpose:
# This file defines a mapping of emotional states to numerical weights.
# It is intended for use by the ATRiAN 'Harmonic Resonance Monitor' functionality (see ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md Section 4.4)
# to assess the emotional or energetic alignment of interactions or system states.
# 
# Structure:
# The file contains a single root key 'emotions', under which key-value pairs represent
# an emotion and its corresponding weight (typically between 0.0 and 1.0).
# 
# Guidance for Modification:
# - Weights can be adjusted based on evolving understanding of their impact within EGOS.
# - New emotions can be added, ensuring they are relevant to the system's context.
# - Ensure YAML syntax is maintained.
