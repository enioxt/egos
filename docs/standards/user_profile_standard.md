# EGOS Standard: User Profile Management (STD-USER-PROFILE-001)

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This standard defines the structure, security requirements, and interaction patterns for user profile data within the EGOS ecosystem. The user profile is a cornerstone for personalization, enabling EGOS subsystems like KARDIA to provide tailored support and insights while upholding the principles of Sacred Privacy and User Autonomy.

The primary goals of this standard are:

- To ensure user data is handled securely and ethically.
- To provide a consistent structure for user profile information across subsystems.
- To empower users with control over their own data.
- To facilitate personalized and adaptive experiences within EGOS.

## 2. Data Schema and Structure

The EGOS User Profile will be structured modularly, allowing for flexibility and incremental additions. A core schema will define essential identifiers and preferences, while extensions can accommodate data specific to subsystems (e.g., KARDIA emotional insights, ATLAS task preferences).

(Initial thoughts on key fields - This will require refinement, potentially using Pydantic models defined elsewhere)

- **Core Profile:**
  - `user_id`: Unique, immutable identifier.
  - `username`: User-defined alias (optional).
  - `preferences`:
    - `interaction_style`: (e.g., 'default', 'direct', 'maiÃªutic', 'empathetic') - User's preferred AI interaction approach. Ref: `MEMORY[...]`, [CONCEPT-MAIEUTIC-001](cci:7://file:///c:/EGOS/docs/concepts/mai%C3%AAutic_interaction.md:0:0-0:0)
    - `organizational_method`: (e.g., 'mission_agenda', 'gtd', 'custom') - Ref: `MEMORY[User Preference for Flexible Organizational Tools]`
    - `notification_settings`: Granular control over subsystem notifications.
    - `privacy_defaults`: Default sharing/visibility settings.
  - `security_settings`:
    - `mfa_enabled`: Boolean.
    - `data_encryption_key_ref`: Reference to user-specific encryption key.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp.

- **Subsystem Extensions (Examples):**
  - `kardia_data`: (Reference to KARDIA-specific data stores, potentially encrypted separately) - Emotional patterns, reflection summaries, mood logs.
  - `atlas_data`: Task history, project preferences, preferred workflow visualizations.
  - `coruja_data`: Communication style preferences, preferred agent personas.

**Data Representation:** JSON or a secure database format will be used. Direct use of `pickle` is forbidden for user profile data due to security risks.

## 3. Security Measures

Adherence to the highest security standards is paramount.

- **Encryption:**
  - **At Rest:** All sensitive user profile data MUST be encrypted using strong, modern algorithms (e.g., AES-256). User-specific keys or envelope encryption patterns should be considered.
  - **In Transit:** All communication involving user profile data MUST use TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Access Control:**
  - **Least Privilege:** Subsystems MUST only be granted access to the specific profile data required for their function.
  - **Authentication & Authorization:** Robust mechanisms MUST be in place to verify user identity and authorize data access requests. ETHIK subsystem plays a key role here.
  - **Audit Trails:** All access and modification attempts on user profiles MUST be logged securely (CRONOS).
- **Data Minimization:** Only essential data required for functionality should be stored. Avoid collecting unnecessary personal information.
- **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Where feasible, data used for analytics or system-wide learning should be anonymized or pseudonymized.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) based on user location and data scope. (Requires further definition).
- **Secret Management:** No hardcoded secrets. API keys, encryption keys, etc., MUST be managed via secure environment variables or a dedicated secrets manager. Ref: `docs/standards/security_practices.md`.

## 4. Interaction Patterns and Governance

- **User Control:** Users MUST have clear interfaces (potentially via KARDIA or a dedicated settings module) to view, manage, and delete their profile data. Explicit consent MUST be obtained for data collection and usage beyond core functionality.
- **Subsystem Access:** Subsystems request profile data via secure internal APIs, validated by ETHIK. Data updates follow a defined protocol, potentially requiring user confirmation for sensitive changes.
- **Data Lifecycle:** Define retention policies and secure deletion procedures for user data upon request or account closure.
- **Updates & Versioning:** Profile schema changes must be versioned and managed carefully to ensure backward compatibility or provide clear migration paths.

## 5. Future Considerations

- Integration with decentralized identity solutions.
- User-managed encryption keys.
- Advanced privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy).
