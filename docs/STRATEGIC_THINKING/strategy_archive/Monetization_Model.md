# Monetization Model

**Status:** Placeholder
**Target Completion:** Q3/Q4 2025

*This document will detail the proposed monetization strategies for EGOS, including Usage-Based Billing, the ETHIK Gamification/Points system, Network Incentives/Fees, and Crypto-Fiat Gateway integration.*

## Models Under Consideration

*   Open Core
*   SaaS (Tiered Subscriptions?)
*   Usage-Based Billing (Define trackable metrics)
*   Transaction Fees (Network/Gateway)
*   Services/Consulting
*   Marketplace

## Key Components to Design

1.  **Usage Metering:** How to track relevant usage across subsystems?
2.  **ETHIK Gamification:** Point allocation rules, reward structure, redemption mechanisms.
3.  **Network Fee/Discount Model:** Percentage calculations, tiered structures, allocation logic.
4.  **Gateway Integration:** Technical requirements, provider selection, fee handling.
5.  **Pricing Tiers/Strategy:** Based on competitive analysis and value proposition.
