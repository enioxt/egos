# ATRiAN Ethical Frameworks Catalog

## 1. Introduction

This document catalogs the ethical frameworks available in the ATRiAN Ethics as a Service (EaaS) API. Each framework represents a structured approach to ethical reasoning based on established ethical theories, industry standards, or regulatory requirements. These frameworks form the foundation for ATRiAN's ethical evaluations and can be used individually or in combination.

## 2. Framework Inclusion Process

### 2.1 Framework Selection Criteria

All ethical frameworks included in ATRiAN meet the following criteria:

1. **Structured Applicability**: The framework can be systematically applied to evaluate actions
2. **Principled Foundation**: The framework is based on recognized ethical principles
3. **Domain Relevance**: The framework addresses ethical concerns relevant to technology applications
4. **Implementation Feasibility**: The framework can be operationalized in the ATRiAN system
5. **Documentation Quality**: The framework is well-documented with clear principles and applications

### 2.2 Framework Development Process

New frameworks are added to ATRiAN through the following process:

1. **Research Phase**: Analysis of framework documentation, principles, and applications
2. **Formalization**: Translation of principles into structured evaluation rules
3. **Implementation**: Coding of evaluation logic in the framework engine
4. **Validation**: Testing against diverse test cases with expert review
5. **Documentation**: Creation of comprehensive framework documentation
6. **Deployment**: Addition to the ATRiAN framework registry

### 2.3 Customization Options

All frameworks can be customized through:

1. **Principle Weighting**: Adjusting the relative importance of different principles
2. **Context Sensitivity**: Defining how context affects principle application
3. **Custom Extensions**: Adding organization-specific principles to standard frameworks
4. **Framework Combination**: Creating meta-frameworks that combine multiple approaches

## 3. General-Purpose Ethical Frameworks

### 3.1 Utilitarian Framework

**ID**: `utilitarian`  
**Version**: 1.2  
**Origin**: Based on classical utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill) with modern adaptations  
**Description**: Evaluates actions based on their consequences, aiming to maximize overall well-being

**Core Principles**:
1. **Consequentialism**: Actions are judged by their outcomes
2. **Utility Maximization**: The best action produces the greatest good for the greatest number
3. **Impartiality**: Each person's well-being counts equally
4. **Aggregation**: Individual benefits and harms can be summed to determine net impact

**Evaluation Approach**:
- Identifies potential outcomes of actions
- Estimates benefits and harms for all affected parties
- Calculates expected utility across scenarios
- Compares alternatives to identify maximum utility option

**Limitations**:
- Difficulty in quantifying diverse impacts
- May allow individual rights violations for collective benefit
- Uncertainty in predicting consequences
- Challenges in comparing different types of benefit/harm

**Example Evaluation**:
```json
{
  "action": "Deploy facial recognition in public spaces",
  "framework": "utilitarian",
  "evaluation": {
    "identified_benefits": [
      "Improved security and crime prevention",
      "Faster identification of missing persons",
      "Efficient crowd management"
    ],
    "identified_harms": [
      "Privacy reduction for all citizens",
      "Potential for surveillance misuse",
      "Chilling effect on free expression"
    ],
    "net_assessment": "The widespread privacy reduction affects all citizens constantly, while security benefits accrue in limited cases. The net utility is negative unless deployment is highly targeted and with strict limitations.",
    "rating": 0.35,
    "confidence": 0.82
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Deontological Framework

**ID**: `deontological`  
**Version**: 1.3  
**Origin**: Based on Kantian ethics with modern adaptations  
**Description**: Evaluates actions based on adherence to moral duties and respect for rational agents

1. **Universalizability**: Actions should be based on principles that could be universal laws
2. **Respect for Persons**: Treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means
3. **Autonomy**: Respect the capacity of rational beings to make their own decisions
4. **Categorical Imperative**: Act according to maxims that could become universal law

**Evaluation Approach**:
- Tests whether the action's underlying principle could be universally applied
- Assesses whether the action respects the autonomy of all involved parties
- Examines whether anyone is being treated merely as a means to an end
- Identifies any contradictions in the universalization of the action's principle
