# Roadmap Modularization Guide (KOIOS-GUIDE-002)

## 1. Introduction

This guide outlines the process for refactoring the EGOS main roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`) into a more modular structure, leveraging subsystem-specific roadmap files for detailed task management. The goal is to enhance readability, maintainability, and alignment with EGOS principles of Conscious Modularity while preserving all necessary context through robust cross-references.

## 2. Objectives

- Simplify the main roadmap by focusing on high-level strategic goals and cross-cutting concerns
- Provide clearer visibility into subsystem-specific plans through dedicated roadmap files
- Maintain complete traceability between high-level goals and specific implementation tasks
- Leverage the cross-reference system to ensure connectivity between roadmap documents
- Improve document size management in alignment with `file_size_modularity_standard.md`

## 3. Process Overview

### 3.1 Preparation Phase

1. **Inventory Existing Roadmaps**
   - Identify all subsystems with existing roadmap files 
   - Evaluate existing format/structure consistency
   - Note any missing subsystem roadmaps that need to be created

2. **Standardize Subsystem Roadmap Template**
   - Create comprehensive template in `docs/templates/subsystem_roadmap_template.md`
   - Ensure proper KOIOS metadata headers
   - Include required cross-references
   - Define standardized section structure

3. **Design Main Roadmap Structure**
   - Define sections to retain in main roadmap (strategic goals, cross-cutting concerns)
   - Create "Subsystem Roadmaps" section with links to all subsystem roadmaps
   - Establish principles for what belongs in main vs. subsystem roadmaps

### 3.2 Implementation Phase

1. **Update Existing Subsystem Roadmaps**
   - Apply the standardized template to all existing subsystem roadmaps
   - Ensure consistent cross-references back to the main roadmap
   - Add unique KOIOS IDs to all subsystem roadmaps

2. **Create Missing Subsystem Roadmaps**
   - Identify any subsystems lacking dedicated roadmap files
   - Create new roadmaps using the template
   - Ensure proper cross-references

3. **Migrate Tasks from Main Roadmap**
   - Systematically review each section of the main roadmap
   - Identify tasks suitable for migration to subsystem roadmaps
   - Move detailed subsystem-specific tasks to their respective roadmaps
   - Replace with summarized entries and cross-references in main roadmap

4. **Restructure Main Roadmap**
   - Reorganize main roadmap to highlight strategic goals and cross-cutting initiatives
   - Add robust "Subsystem Roadmaps" section with links to all subsystem roadmaps
   - Ensure main roadmap remains a useful high-level guide to the project

### 3.3 Verification Phase

1. **Cross-Reference Verification**
   - Run cross-reference verification tools to ensure all links are valid
   - Verify bidirectional linking between main and subsystem roadmaps
   - Ensure no orphaned references or dead links

2. **Content Verification**
   - Ensure no information was lost during migration
   - Verify that high-level goals in main roadmap are properly reflected in subsystem details
   - Check that dependencies between subsystems are clearly documented

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Update contribution guidelines to reflect new roadmap structure
   - Document the process for maintaining the modular roadmap system

## 4. Main Roadmap Structure

The refactored main roadmap should include these key sections:

1. **Introduction and Overview**
   - Project vision and mission
   - Core EGOS principles guiding development
   - Current phase and focus areas

2. **Strategic Goals**
   - High-level project objectives
   - Cross-cutting initiatives
   - Success metrics and targets

3. **Subsystem Roadmaps**
   - Links to all subsystem-specific roadmaps
   - Brief summary of each subsystem's focus and current priorities

4. **Integration Points**
   - Critical dependencies between subsystems
   - Integration milestones and status

5. **Timeline and Planning**
   - Major milestones
   - Release planning
   - Current phase summary

## 5. Subsystem Roadmap Structure

Each subsystem roadmap should follow the template defined in `docs/templates/subsystem_roadmap_template.md`, which includes:

1. **KOIOS-compliant metadata header**
2. **Overview of subsystem purpose and scope**
3. **Current focus and priorities**
4. **Tasks categorized by status** (Completed, In Progress, Planned)
5. **Integration points with other subsystems**
6. **Future directions**
7. **References**

## 6. Guidance for Task Distribution

| Belongs in Main Roadmap | Belongs in Subsystem Roadmap |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Strategic project goals | Implementation details |
| Cross-cutting initiatives affecting multiple subsystems | Subsystem-specific tasks and features |
| Major project milestones | Sub-tasks and implementation steps |
| High-level phase planning | Detailed timelines for feature implementation |
| Integration/dependency overview between subsystems | Specific API/interface requirements |
