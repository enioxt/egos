Can this be understood by a non-expert in a specific sub-field?\n*   **Actionability Check:** Does the analysis lead to clear, actionable recommendations?\n*   **Integration Check:** How does this section's analysis connect with and influence other sections? Are there any contradictions or tensions to resolve?\n\n**Output Structure and Formatting:**\n\n*   **Interconnectivity:** Crucially, **explicitly state the interdependencies *between* the different analysis areas.** Show how technical decisions impact financials, how market trends influence positioning, how ethics shapes brand, etc.\n*   Use Markdown effectively for clarity (bullet points, bolding, italics, code blocks for snippets if relevant, simple tables).\n\n**Output:**\n\nGenerate a comprehensive, detailed, and integrated strategic analysis report addressing all sections above for the `[Specific Context/Focus]`. Begin with a concise, high-impact **Executive Summary** synthesizing the key findings and core strategic recommendations.
