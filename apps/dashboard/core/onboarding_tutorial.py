        The EGOS Dashboard is organized into several key sections, accessible via the **sidebar navigation** on the left:

        *   **üìä Dashboard**: Your main view for real-time system activity, including SPARC tasks, LLM interactions, and propagation logs.
        *   **üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Governance**: Monitor key ethical metrics, DEV validation, ETHIK compliance, ATRiAN EaaS usage, and $ETHIK token activity. You can also visualize the ethical evaluation workflow here.
        *   **üìù Feedback**: Submit your feedback or suggestions about the EGOS system or the dashboard itself.
        *   **üöÄ Onboarding Tutorial**: (You are here!) Revisit this guide anytime.

        *   **LLM Interactions**: Logs interactions with Large Language Models within the EGOS ecosystem.
        *   **Propagation Log**: Tracks the flow of information and decisions through the system.
        
        These sections update in real-time if 'Use Live Data' is enabled and the NATS messaging system is connected.

        *   **ATRiAN EaaS Usage**: Monitor the usage of the Ethics as a Service API.
        *   **$ETHIK Token Activity**: Get insights into the $ETHIK token's performance and distribution.
