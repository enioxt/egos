# ATRiAN Architecture Diagram Specification

## Overview

This document provides specifications for creating architecture diagrams for the ATRiAN module. These diagrams will serve as visual documentation of the system's components, their interactions, and integration points with the Windsurf IDE.

The diagrams follow EGOS design principles and use a consistent visual language to ensure clarity and maintainability. They are intended to be used in conjunction with the written documentation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ATRiAN system.

## MQP Alignment

The architecture diagrams should visually represent the following MQP principles:

- **Conscious Modularity (CM)**: Show clear component boundaries and interfaces
- **Systemic Cartography (SC)**: Provide a comprehensive map of the system
- **Integrated Ethics (IE)**: Highlight ethical evaluation components
- **Reciprocal Trust (RT)**: Illustrate trust relationship flows
- **Sacred Privacy (SP)**: Identify privacy-sensitive components and data flows

## Implementation Guidelines

### Tools

The following tools are recommended for creating ATRiAN architecture diagrams:

1. **Draw.io / diagrams.net**: Primary tool for creating all diagram types
2. **PlantUML**: Alternative for UML-based diagrams
3. **Mermaid**: For simple diagrams that can be embedded in Markdown

### File Format Standards

- Source files should be stored in the `docs/diagrams/source` directory
- Export diagrams as SVG for web display and PNG for documentation
- Use the naming convention: `atrian_[diagram_type]_[version].svg`
- Include the diagram source files in version control

### Visual Standards

#### Colors

- **Core Components**: Deep Indigo (`#2c3e50`)
- **Integration Components**: Luminous Teal (`#1abc9c`)
- **UI Components**: Warm Gold (`#f1c40f`)
- **Data Flows**: Gradient from source to destination color
- **Privacy-Sensitive Components**: Red accent (`#e74c3c`)

#### Shapes

- **Core Components**: Rectangles with rounded corners
- **Interfaces**: Lollipop notation or dashed rectangles
- **Data Stores**: Cylinders or parallel lines
- **External Systems**: Clouds or rectangles with dashed borders
- **Processes**: Circles or rounded rectangles

#### Text

- **Component Names**: Bold, centered
- **Interface Names**: Italic
- **Annotations**: Regular, smaller font
- **Data Flow Labels**: Along the flow line, regular font

### Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
- Include text labels for all components and relationships
- Provide alternative text descriptions for all diagrams
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

## Maintenance and Updates

Architecture diagrams should be updated when:

1. New components are added to the system
2. Component interactions change significantly
3. New integration points are established
4. Data flows are modified
5. Major version updates are released

Each update should:

1. Increment the version number in the filename
2. Update the corresponding documentation
3. Include a changelog entry
4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Conclusion

These architecture diagram specifications provide a consistent framework for visually documenting the ATRiAN system. By following these guidelines, we ensure that the diagrams effectively communicate the system's structure and behavior while maintaining alignment with EGOS principles and standards.

The diagrams should be created as part of the documentation process and updated regularly to reflect the current state of the system. They serve as valuable references for developers, maintainers, and users of the ATRiAN module.
