# üõ†Ô∏è EGOS - Tools Directory

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-16

**Purpose:** This directory houses helper scripts and tools primarily focused on development workflow, code quality, and environment setup within the EGOS project.

**Guiding Principles:**

*   Tools should automate repetitive development tasks.
*   Tools should enforce project standards (linting, formatting).
*   Dependencies required by tools should be clearly documented.

---

## Contents

*   `add_metadata.bat`: Batch script presumably used to add or update metadata in project files according to KOIOS standards.
*   `fix_linting.py`: Python script likely designed to automatically fix linting errors detected by tools like Ruff.
*   `install_dependencies.bat`: Batch script for setting up the development environment by installing necessary project dependencies (e.g., Python packages from `requirements.txt`).
*   `lint_format_check.bat`: Batch script to run linters and formatters (like Ruff) to check code quality and consistency.

**(Note:** These tools are essential for maintaining code health and developer productivity. Ensure they are kept up-to-date with project standards and dependencies.)
