# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Testing Framework

## 1. Executive Summary

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Testing Framework provides a comprehensive approach to testing MCP servers within the EGOS ecosystem. This framework ensures that all MCP implementations adhere to the established standards, perform reliably under various conditions, and maintain consistent terminology and behavior. By implementing this testing framework, EGOS can ensure high-quality MCP servers that provide seamless integration between AI systems and external tools or data sources.

## 2. Core Principles

Aligned with the EGOS Master Quantum Prompt (MQP) principles, this testing framework embodies:

- **Universal Accessibility:** Tests ensure MCP servers are accessible across different platforms and environments
- **Integrated Ethics:** Testing includes ethical considerations and bias detection
- **Conscious Modularity:** Framework is designed with modular components that can be adapted for different MCP servers
- **Systemic Cartography:** Tests map the relationships and dependencies between MCP components
- **Evolutionary Preservation:** Testing history is preserved to track improvements over time

## 3. Framework Architecture

### 3.1. Testing Layers

The MCP Testing Framework is structured in four primary layers:

1. **Unit Testing Layer:** Tests individual functions and methods within the MCP server implementation
2. **Integration Testing Layer:** Tests interactions between components within a single MCP server
3. **System Testing Layer:** Tests the complete MCP server as a whole system
4. **Acceptance Testing Layer:** Tests the MCP server from an end-user perspective

### 3.2. Core Components

```python
# Test Case Template
{
    "test_id": "MCP-TEST-001",
    "title": "Basic Function Call",
    "description": "Tests a basic function call to the MCP server",
    "category": "Functional",
    "priority": "High",
    "prerequisites": [
        "MCP server is running",
        "Test client is configured"
    ],
    "steps": [
        {
            "step_id": 1,
            "description": "Send function call request",
            "action": "client.send_request(sample_request)",
            "expected_result": "Server returns 200 OK with valid response"
        },
        {
            "step_id": 2,
            "description": "Validate response format",
            "action": "validator.check_response(response, schema)",

        }
    ],
    "cleanup": [
        "Reset server state"
    ]
}
```

### 5.2. Test Automation

The framework supports automated testing through:

- **Test Scripts:** Python-based test scripts using pytest
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions workflows for continuous testing
- **Scheduled Tests:** Regular automated test runs

$ egos-cli mcp test run --category functional

# Run all tests
$ egos-cli mcp test run-all
```

#### 5.3.2. CI/CD Environment

For automated testing in continuous integration:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
name: MCP Server Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        egos-cli mcp test run-all --ci
    - name: Upload test results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: test-results/
```

#### 5.3.3. Production Simulation Environment

For testing in an environment that closely resembles production:

```bash
# Create production-like environment
$ egos-cli mcp test setup-prod-sim

# Run performance tests
$ egos-cli mcp test run --category performance --env prod-sim
```

## 6. Cost-Effective Testing Strategies

### 6.1. Local Testing

Minimize cloud costs by running tests locally:

- Containerized environments using Docker
- Local mock services instead of actual cloud services
- Offline testing with cached responses

### 6.2. Open-Source Tools

Leverage free and open-source tools:

- **Pytest:** Testing framework
- **Locust:** Load testing
- **Postman/Newman:** API testing
- **SQLite:** Local database for testing
- **Wiremock:** Service mocking

### 6.3. Efficient Test Data Management

Reduce storage and processing costs:

- Synthetic data generation
- Data reuse across test cases
- Compression of test artifacts
- Cleanup of test data after test completion

### 6.4. Selective Testing

Run only necessary tests:

- Risk-based test selection
- Change-based test selection
- Test prioritization based on historical data

## 7. External User Simulation

### 7.1. User Personas

Define realistic user personas for testing:

- **AI Developer:** Integrating MCP with an AI system
- **System Administrator:** Deploying and configuring MCP servers

- **Security Auditor:** Evaluating MCP security

### 7.2. Scenario-Based Testing

Create realistic usage scenarios:

- **Development Workflow:** Testing during AI system development
- **Production Deployment:** Testing in production-like environments
- **Scaling Scenario:** Testing during traffic spikes
- **Recovery Scenario:** Testing after system failures

### 7.3. User Interaction Simulation

Simulate realistic user behavior:

- Varying request patterns
- Concurrent requests
- Interrupted connections
- Retry patterns

## 8. Comprehensive Coverage

### 8.1. Coverage Metrics

Track testing coverage across different dimensions:

- **Code Coverage:** Percentage of code executed during tests
- **Feature Coverage:** Percentage of features tested
- **Requirement Coverage:** Percentage of requirements verified
- **Scenario Coverage:** Percentage of user scenarios tested

### 8.2. MCP Server Inventory

Maintain an inventory of all MCP servers to ensure complete coverage:

```json
// Example MCP Server Inventory
[
  {
    "name": "filesystem",
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "description": "File system operations MCP server",
    "endpoints": ["create_directory", "read_file", "write_file", "list_directory"],
    "test_suite": "mcp-filesystem-tests",
    "last_tested": "2025-05-20",
    "test_coverage": 92
  },
  {
    "name": "github",
    "version": "1.0.5",
    "description": "GitHub integration MCP server",
    "endpoints": ["create_issue", "list_repositories", "create_pull_request"],
    "test_suite": "mcp-github-tests",
    "last_tested": "2025-05-18",
    "test_coverage": 87
  }
]
```

### 8.3. Gap Analysis

Regularly identify and address testing gaps:

- Untested features or endpoints
- Incomplete test scenarios
- Missing edge cases
- Insufficient performance testing

## 9. Terminology Consistency Verification

### 9.1. Terminology Rules

Define clear rules for terminology:

- **Correct Terms:** "Model Context Protocol", "MCP", "MCP server", "MCP client"
- **Incorrect Terms:** "model context prompt", "m-c-p", "model-context-prompt"

### 9.2. Automated Terminology Checking

Implement automated checks for terminology:

```python
# Example terminology checking function
def check_terminology(text):
    incorrect_terms = {
        "model context prompt": "Model Context Protocol",
        "m-c-p": "MCP",
        "model-context-prompt": "Model Context Protocol"
    }
    
    findings = []
    for incorrect, correct in incorrect_terms.items():
        if re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(incorrect) + r'\b', text, re.IGNORECASE):
            findings.append({
                "incorrect": incorrect,
                "correct": correct,
                "context": # extract surrounding context
            })
    
    return findings
```

### 9.3. Documentation Analysis

Scan documentation for terminology issues:

- README files
- API documentation
- Code comments
- User guides

### 9.4. Code Analysis

Analyze code for terminology consistency:

- Variable and function names
- Comments
- String literals
- Log messages
