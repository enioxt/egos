# EGOS Documentation Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating EGOS documentation to the new structure as identified in the [DOCS_DIRECTORY_DIAGNOSTIC_20250518.md](../../diagnostics/DOCS_DIRECTORY_DIAGNOSTIC_20250518.md) document. The migration will be conducted in phases, with careful attention to preserving cross-references and ensuring system integrity.

## Migration Principles

1. **Preserve Cross-References**: Maintain the integrity of all cross-references throughout the documentation.
2. **Minimize Disruption**: Implement changes in a way that minimizes disruption to ongoing work.
3. **Validate Each Step**: Verify the integrity of the documentation after each migration step.
4. **Document Changes**: Maintain a detailed log of all changes made during the migration.
5. **Follow KOIOS Standards**: Ensure all migrated documentation adheres to KOIOS documentation standards.

## Phase 1: Preparation (Completed)

- [x] Create diagnostic document: `DOCS_DIRECTORY_DIAGNOSTIC_20250518.md`
- [x] Identify issues and recommend solutions
- [x] Move system organization documents to appropriate location:
  - [x] `SYSTEM_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` → `docs/governance/reorganization/`
  - [x] `SYSTEM_ORGANIZATION_TASKS.md` → `docs/governance/reorganization/`
- [x] Create English-named directories and move content:
  - [x] `projetos` → `projects`
- [x] Create logs directory and move log files:
  - [x] Move log files from `markdown/` to `logs/`
- [x] Create project_documentation directory structure:
  - [x] `project_documentation/core/`
  - [x] `project_documentation/architecture/`
  - [x] `project_documentation/standards/`
  - [x] `project_documentation/guides/`
  - [x] `project_documentation/reference/`
  - [x] `project_documentation/governance/`
  - [x] `project_documentation/subsystems/`

## Phase 2: Cross-Reference Analysis

### 2.1 Cross-Reference Mapping

Before moving any core documents, we need to create a comprehensive map of all cross-references in the system. This will be done using the following approach:

1. **Identify Key Documents**: Create a list of all key documents that need to be migrated.
2. **Map Current References**: For each document, identify all incoming and outgoing references.
3. **Create Reference Graph**: Visualize the reference relationships to identify clusters and dependencies.
4. **Identify Reference Patterns**: Analyze the patterns of references to determine the most efficient migration approach.

### 2.2 Cross-Reference Update Strategy

Based on the cross-reference mapping, we will implement one of the following strategies:

1. **Symlink Approach**: Create symbolic links from old locations to new locations during a transition period.
2. **Redirect Files**: Create redirect files at old locations that point to new locations.
3. **Automated Reference Updates**: Use scripts to automatically update all references to point to new locations.
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine multiple strategies based on the specific context of each document.

## Phase 3: Content Migration

### 3.1 Core Documents

1. **MQP.md**:
   - Current Location: `docs/reference/MQP.md`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/core/MQP.md`
   - Cross-Reference Count: 25+ (based on initial analysis)
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

2. **ROADMAP.md**:
   - Current Location: `ROADMAP.md` (root)
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/core/ROADMAP.md`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

### 3.2 Reference Documents

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**:
   - Current Location: `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

2. **STRATEGY.md**:
   - Current Location: `docs/reference/STRATEGY.md`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/core/STRATEGY.md`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

### 3.3 Standards Documents

1. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Current Locations: Various `.mdc` files in `docs/reference/`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/standards/documentation/`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

2. **Coding Standards**:
   - Current Locations: Various `.mdc` files in `docs/reference/`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/standards/code/`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

### 3.4 Governance Documents

1. **Governance Documents**:
   - Current Location: `docs/governance/`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/governance/`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

### 3.5 Subsystem Documentation

1. **Subsystem Documentation**:
   - Current Location: `docs/subsystems/`
   - Target Location: `docs/project_documentation/subsystems/`
   - Cross-Reference Count: TBD
   - Migration Strategy: TBD based on cross-reference analysis

## Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup

### 4.1 Cross-Reference Validation

After migration, we will validate all cross-references to ensure they are working correctly:

1. **Automated Validation**: Run cross-reference validation scripts to identify any broken references.
2. **Manual Validation**: Perform manual checks on key documents to ensure they are correctly referenced.
3. **Fix Broken References**: Address any broken references identified during validation.

### 4.2 Content Validation

Ensure all migrated content adheres to KOIOS documentation standards:

1. **Metadata Validation**: Verify that all documents have correct YAML metadata.
2. **Format Validation**: Ensure all documents follow consistent formatting.
3. **Structure Validation**: Verify that documents are organized according to the new structure.

### 4.3 Cleanup

Remove any temporary files or structures created during the migration:

1. **Remove Temporary Files**: Delete any temporary files created during migration.
2. **Archive Old Structure**: Archive the old structure for reference if needed.
3. **Update Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new structure.

## Phase 5: Documentation and Training

### 5.1 Update Documentation Structure Documentation

Update the documentation structure documentation to reflect the new structure:

1. **Update `documentation_structure.mdc`**: Modify the documentation structure standard to reflect the new structure.
2. **Create Migration Guide**: Document the migration process for future reference.
3. **Update Cross-Reference Guide**: Update the cross-reference guide to reflect the new structure.

### 5.2 Team Training

Ensure all team members are familiar with the new structure:

1. **Create Training Materials**: Develop materials to help team members understand the new structure.
2. **Conduct Training Sessions**: Hold sessions to walk through the new structure and answer questions.
3. **Provide Reference Materials**: Create quick reference guides for the new structure.

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Broken Cross-References**: Migration may break existing references.
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive cross-reference analysis before migration.
   - Contingency: Automated tools to fix broken references.

2. **Content Loss**: Files may be lost during migration.
   - Mitigation: Create backups before migration.
   - Contingency: Restore from backups if needed.

3. **Inconsistent Structure**: New structure may not be consistently applied.
   - Mitigation: Clear guidelines and automated validation.
   - Contingency: Manual review and correction.

4. **Team Resistance**: Team members may resist the new structure.
   - Mitigation: Clear communication and training.
   - Contingency: One-on-one support for team members who need it.

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to reorganizing the EGOS documentation while preserving cross-references and ensuring system integrity. By following this plan, we can achieve a more organized and maintainable documentation structure that aligns with KOIOS standards and supports the ongoing development of the EGOS project.
