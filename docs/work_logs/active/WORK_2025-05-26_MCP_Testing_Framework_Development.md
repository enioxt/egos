# Work Title: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Testing Framework Development

**Date:** 2025-05-26
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Roadmap IDs:** MCP-TEST-01, MCP-QUALITY-02

## 1. Objective

To develop a comprehensive testing framework for all Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers within the EGOS ecosystem, ensuring reliability, performance, and compatibility across implementations.

## 2. Context

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a critical standard within EGOS that connects AI systems with external tools and data sources. As the number of MCP servers grows, ensuring consistent behavior, terminology, and performance becomes increasingly important. This work aims to create a standardized testing approach that can be applied to all current and future MCP servers.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Primary Goals

- **Simulate Real-World Usage:** Create tests that mimic realistic user interactions to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
- **Cost-Effective Testing:** Utilize free platforms, offline environments, or open-source tools to minimize expenses during the testing phase.
- **External User Simulation:** Ensure that the testing environment accurately represents scenarios involving external users interacting with the MCP servers.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Test all MCP servers extensively to uncover barriers, problems, and opportunities for continuous improvement.
- **Terminology Consistency:** Verify that all references to the protocol are correctly labeled as 'Model Context Protocol' or 'MCP', and identify incorrect terms like 'model context prompt' or 'm-c-p'.

## 4. Research Findings

### 4.1 Existing Testing Approaches for API/Protocol Systems

- **Contract Testing:** Ensures that the API adheres to its specified contract (e.g., OpenAPI specification)
- **Integration Testing:** Verifies that different components work together correctly
- **Load Testing:** Evaluates performance under expected and peak loads
- **Security Testing:** Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures proper authentication/authorization
- **Mocking/Stubbing:** Simulates dependencies to isolate testing of specific components

### 4.2 Relevant Open-Source Tools

- **Postman/Newman:** API testing and automation
- **JMeter:** Load and performance testing
- **Pact:** Contract testing between service consumers and providers
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** API documentation and contract definition
- **Wiremock:** HTTP mock server for stubbing APIs
- **Locust:** Open-source load testing tool
- **Pytest:** Python testing framework with extensive plugin ecosystem

## 5. Proposed Testing Framework

### 5.1 Framework Architecture

[To be detailed - Will include core components, testing layers, and integration points]

### 5.2 Testing Categories

[To be detailed - Will include functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and compatibility testing]

### 5.3 Test Environment Setup

[To be detailed - Will include local development environment, CI/CD integration, and production simulation]

### 5.4 Test Data Management

[To be detailed - Will include synthetic data generation, anonymization, and versioning]

## 6. Next Steps

- ⬜ Research existing MCP server implementations to identify common patterns and requirements
- ⬜ Define test categories and specific test cases for each MCP server
- ⬜ Develop test harness and automation framework
- ⬜ Create documentation and guidelines for test implementation
- ⬜ Implement initial test suite for a pilot MCP server
- ⬜ Establish CI/CD integration for continuous testing
