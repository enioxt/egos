# Work Title: Global Rules Refinement, Work Log Standardization, and Session Planning

**Date:** 2025-05-26
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Roadmap IDs:** N/A

## 1. Objective

To refine and update EGOS operational rules and documentation standards, specifically focusing on `global_rules.md` and `WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md`. Additionally, to review current project status via `ROADMAP.md` and plan immediate next steps for the EGOS project.

## 2. Context

This session continues the ongoing effort to enhance the EGOS operational framework, ensuring methodological precision, systemic coherence, and alignment with MQP v9.0 principles. The focus is on establishing robust standards for documentation and work tracking to improve information capture and future searchability.

## 3. Completed Tasks

### 3.1 Global Rules Update
- ‚úÖ User updated `global_rules.md` (via `.windsurfrules` memory update mechanism) with new and refined operational rules.
- ‚úÖ Cascade acknowledged and integrated these rules for ongoing collaboration.

### 3.2 README.md Enhancement
- ‚úÖ Added "üèõÔ∏è Core Operational Standards & Governance" section to `C:\EGOS\README.md` to reflect the updated governance framework (completed in a previous session, relevant context for today).

### 3.3 Work Log Standardization Document Review & Update
- ‚úÖ Located and reviewed `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md`.
- ‚úÖ Proposed and implemented several enhancements to the standard, including:
    - `snake_case` for filenames.
    - Revised location for active work logs to `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\active\`.
    - Refined `author` field suggestions.
    - Added `status` options: "On Hold", "Deferred".
    - Added optional `adrs_ids` field to YAML frontmatter.
    - Added "AI Assistant Contributions" section to the template.
    - Added reference to `global_rules.md` in the main context section.
- ‚úÖ Successfully updated `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md` with these changes.

### 3.4 Project Status Review & Planning
- ‚úÖ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ROADMAP.md` (v1.6) to understand current project phases and task statuses.
- ‚úÖ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ADRS_Log.md` (currently empty).
- ‚úÖ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\WORK_2025-05-25_CRONOS_Product_Brief_Completion_And_Documentation_Updates.md`.
- ‚úÖ Discussed and outlined a plan for script analysis and dynamic standards referencing for system health checks.
- ‚úÖ Formulated a multi-phase plan for immediate next steps.

## 4. Next Steps

- [ ] **Task 1.3 (from plan):** Verify and Complete CRONOS Documentation Updates in `README.md`.
- [ ] **Script Analysis Phase:**
    - [ ] List all scripts in `C:\EGOS\scripts\` and other relevant locations.
    - [ ] Identify key/critical scripts based on cross-referencing and documentation.
    - [ ] Review `script_standards_scanner.py` capabilities.
    - [ ] Define which current EGOS standards can be made machine-readable for dynamic checking.
    - [ ] Plan enhancements for `script_standards_scanner.py` (or a new script) to load and apply these externalized standards.
- [ ] **Address Key "In Progress" Roadmap Items:** (e.g., `MCP-TEST-FRMWK-001`, `KOIOS-001-03`)

## 5. Modified Files

- `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md` (Updated)
- `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\active\WORK_2025-05-26_global_rules_refinement_and_work_planning.md` (This file - Created)

## 6. AI Assistant Contributions

- Analyzed user requests and EGOS documentation (`global_rules.md`, `WORK_Log_Standardization.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, etc.).
- Proposed changes to `WORK_Log_Standardization.md`.
- Utilized `view_file` tool to inspect document contents.
- Utilized `replace_file_content` tool to update `WORK_Log_Standardization.md`.
- Utilized `write_to_file` tool to create this work log.
- Collaborated on planning next steps for EGOS development.
