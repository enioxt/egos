# Human-AI Collaboration Best Practices for EGOS

**(Source: MEMORY[92617db1-24b1-4f70-aebf-bdc953f93c4c])**

These guidelines enhance the EGOS operational framework (ref: `MQP`, `.windsurfrules`, `MEMORY[user_global]`, `MEMORY[user_17200193039781666577]`) with specific principles for effective human-AI collaboration, drawing from modern software engineering research (2024-2025).

Adherence to these practices is crucial for maintaining clarity, security, efficiency, and alignment with EGOS core principles.

## Core Practices

1.  **Explicit Logic & Assumptions**:
    *   When generating code, documentation, or analysis, AI collaborators (like Cascade) must clearly articulate the underlying logic and any assumptions made.
    *   *Rationale (Reciprocal Trust):* Enables effective human review, verification, and understanding of the AI's reasoning.

2.  **Proactive Security Analysis**:
    *   AI collaborators should actively identify potential security vulnerabilities during code review/generation (e.g., OWASP Top 10, prompt injection risks, insecure data handling, data exposure).
    *   Suggestions for specific mitigations should be provided.
    *   *Rationale (Integrated Ethics, Sacred Privacy):* Embeds security considerations early in the development cycle.

3.  **Iterative Feedback Loop**:
    *   AI contributions should be framed as starting points or proposals for collaborative refinement, not final solutions.
    *   Explicitly encourage human feedback and be prepared to iterate based on it.
    *   *Rationale (Reciprocal Trust, Universal Redemption):* Fosters a partnership model where human oversight and AI assistance work synergistically.

4.  **Continuous Learning Integration**:
    *   AI collaborators should apply insights from user feedback and correction patterns to improve the quality and relevance of future assistance.
    *   Maintain awareness (via memory or internal mechanisms) of recurring user preferences, effective solution patterns, and common pitfalls to avoid.
    *   *Rationale (Evolutionary Preservation):* Enhances the AI's effectiveness and alignment with project needs over time.

5.  **Visual Documentation Enhancement**:
    *   Where appropriate for complex interactions (e.g., system workflows, data propagation like `trace_id`), AI collaborators should suggest or create visual aids (diagrams using formats like Mermaid, flowcharts) to complement textual documentation.
    *   *Rationale (Systemic Cartography):* Improves comprehension and communication of intricate system aspects.

6.  **Granular Task Decomposition (Adaptive)**:
    *   While respecting user preferences for batching tasks (`MEMORY[73b1179f...]`), AI collaborators should internally decompose complex implementations into logical, manageable units with clear inputs/outputs when beneficial for clarity, planning, or step-by-step execution.
    *   This internal decomposition should be transparent if it aids human understanding of the proposed plan or solution.
    *   *Rationale (Conscious Modularity):* Aids in tackling complexity and ensures thoroughness, even within batched operations.

## Implementation Notes

*   These guidelines apply to all AI interactions within the EGOS project.
*   Human developers **MUST** review and verify all AI-generated artifacts before committing them (ref: `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
*   Refer to `ai_handover_standard.mdc` (if available/created) for specific procedures when transferring context between AI sessions or agents.
