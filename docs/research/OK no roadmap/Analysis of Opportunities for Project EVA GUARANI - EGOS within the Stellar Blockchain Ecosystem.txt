Analysis of Opportunities for Project "EVA GUARANI - EGOS" within the Stellar Blockchain Ecosystem1. Introduction to the Stellar Blockchain NetworkThe Stellar network stands as a decentralized, public blockchain infrastructure designed to empower builders in unlocking human and economic potential globally.1 Its core purpose is to enhance access to the global financial system by providing a platform for the creation of innovative digital asset products and services.1 Stellar distinguishes itself through its emphasis on real-world impact, offering a network that is faster, cheaper, and significantly more energy-efficient compared to many other blockchain systems.1 This design prioritizes the long-term growth of its ecosystem and aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets.1 By providing tools for asset tokenization and supporting a global ecosystem of innovators, Stellar facilitates a wide array of applications, including payments, remittances, consumer-focused digital wallets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) through its smart contract capabilities.12. Core Features and Technology of the Stellar NetworkStellar operates as a decentralized blockchain, meaning no single entity controls the network.1 A key characteristic is its ability to facilitate near-instant global payments at a low cost, making it particularly suitable for cross-border transactions.1 The network's energy efficiency is a significant advantage, aligning with growing environmental concerns associated with blockchain technology.1 Stellar supports smart contracts through its Soroban platform, which is built using the Rust programming language and designed for scalability and security.1 This allows developers to build sophisticated decentralized applications with real-world utility.1 Furthermore, Stellar provides the tools necessary for asset tokenization, enabling the creation and management of digital representations of various assets.1 The network also fosters a global ecosystem, supported by an anchor network spanning over 180 countries and facilitating on- and off-ramps between digital assets and fiat currencies.1 The focus on composability allows for the integration of different components to create complex financial systems.13. Developer Resources and Smart Contract CapabilitiesStellar offers a comprehensive suite of resources, documentation, and tools for developers looking to build on its network.3 The developer section of the Stellar website provides access to detailed technical documentation, including API references, SDK implementations, and CLI guides. Developers can also find video tutorials covering a range of Stellar concepts and implementations. The Stellar Lab provides a testing environment to experiment with network features.3 For building smart contracts, the Soroban platform offers complete tools and documentation, with Rust being a supported programming language. The documentation guides developers through the process of setting up their environment, creating basic and more complex smart contracts, deploying them to the testnet, managing data, and building front-end interfaces.2 Example contracts are also available as a starting point.2 The developer community on Stellar is active and provides support through platforms like Discord, GitHub, and Stack Exchange.4. The Stellar Community Fund (SCF)The Stellar Community Fund (SCF) is an innovative, community-driven awards program designed to empower developers and startups building on the Stellar network. Its primary goal is to accelerate the development of sustainable and high-impact projects within the Stellar ecosystem by leveraging community input for funding and support. The SCF offers tailored support through two main pathways: the Kickstart Award and the Build Award.4.1. Kickstart AwardThe Kickstart Award is ideal for early-stage ideas and helps teams refine their Stellar-based concept and find product-market fit after completing a preparatory bootcamp. This program includes a 5-day virtual design sprint with expert mentorship.4 Participants can win up to $15,000 in XLM to further validate their projects. Eligibility for the Kickstart Award requires meeting general SCF criteria, completing a Kickstart cohort, demonstrating an interest in building on Stellar, and submitting a high-quality, clear, and technically detailed proposal. The project should be unique, competitive, and provide clear value to the Stellar ecosystem, with a well-researched or tested concept, MVP, or high-level architecture model, clearly explaining Stellar integration and team readiness.4.2. Build AwardThe Build Award is suited for more advanced projects and facilitates their launch and growth by covering essential development costs. Eligible projects meeting validation requirements can apply for up to $150,000 in XLM, disbursed across tranches to support project launch. Eligibility for the Build Award includes meeting general SCF criteria and demonstrating sufficient product-market fit through user traction or a validated need within the Stellar ecosystem. Submissions need to be high quality, clear, and technically detailed, explaining Stellar integration with a technical architecture outline and demonstrating development readiness.8 The project should significantly improve core features using Stellar, and if involving Soroban smart contracts, a plan to open-source them is required.8 The requested budget should be reasonable and cover development costs on Stellar, with tranches separated into MVP, Testnet, and Mainnet phases with feasible deliverables.8 Uniqueness and clear value to the Stellar ecosystem are also crucial.84.3. Application Process for SCFThe application process for the SCF begins with submitting a project abstract through the SCF Dashboard. A panel reviews these ideas for ecosystem value, eligibility, and team capability. Following this review, projects may be invited to submit a full application for either the Kickstart or Build program. Build Award submissions undergo a pre-screen and panel review based on specific criteria set by Category Delegate Panels, determining which projects proceed to a community vote. Projects need to achieve at least a 67% NQG approval rate in the community vote to be considered for final approval by the Category Delegate Panels. Selected projects then complete KYC/KYB checks before award distribution in tranches based on achieving milestones like MVP, Testnet launch, and Mainnet launch. SCF Build Award rounds occur every 6 weeks.9The following table summarizes the key features of the SCF Kickstart and Build Award funding tracks:Funding TrackPurposeTarget AudienceAward SizeKey Eligibility CriteriaKickstart AwardHelps teams develop their Stellar idea and find product market fit after completing the bootcamp.Early-stage teams with promising ideas who need guidance or don't have significant traction yet.≤$15,000 in XLM*Completed a Kickstart Cohort; Interest in building on Stellar; High-quality submission; Clear Stellar integration plan.Build AwardSupports project launch by covering essential development costs.Ready-to-build projects with validated Product Market Fit (proven by significant existing traction or validated ecosystem need).≤$150,000 in XLM*Demonstrated Product Market Fit; High-quality submission; Clear Stellar integration plan with technical architecture; Development readiness.<br/>5.
