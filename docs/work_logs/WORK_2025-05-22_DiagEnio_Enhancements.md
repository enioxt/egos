## EGOS Work Log: 2025-05-22

### Objective:
Enhance `DiagEnio.md` for improved clarity, actionability, and integration with project planning documents (`ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`).

### Tasks Completed:

1.  **Enhanced `C:\EGOS\DiagEnio.md` based on user feedback:**
    *   **Updated Table of Contents:** Revised to include all new sections (N, O) and Appendix D, and correctly list existing sections K, L, and M.
    *   **Actionable Cross-References:** Added notes in "Strategic Recommendations," "K. Consolidated System-Wide Findings," and "L. Implementation Prioritization Framework" sections, advising the use of `(Ref: ROADMAP.md#TASK_ID)` to link diagnostic points to `ROADMAP.md` tasks.
    *   **Visual Summaries (Mermaid Diagrams):**
        *   Embedded a Mermaid diagram summarizing the "Implementation Prioritization Framework" within Section L.
        *   Embedded a Mermaid diagram outlining the "GitHub Synchronization Strategy" within Section M.
    *   **New Section "N. Maintaining This Document":** Added to provide guidance on keeping `DiagEnio.md` current and relevant.
    *   **New Section "O. Leveraging DiagEnio.md for Strategic Advantage":** Added a comprehensive section detailing how to best utilize `DiagEnio.md` in conjunction with `ROADMAP.md` and `README.md` for strategic planning, onboarding, and progress tracking.
    *   **New "Appendix D: Overview of Key Root Files":** Added an appendix summarizing the purpose and relevance of key files located in the `C:\EGOS\` root directory.

### Next Steps:
*   Integrate `DiagEnio.md` more formally by adding links to it in `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` (Completed in subsequent steps of this session).
*   Prepare changes for commit, push, and merge to the GitHub repository.
