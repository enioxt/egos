# needs to happen at the CronosService level, as that service is now responsible
# for applying the policy and pruning the self.backups dict BEFORE calling
# BackupManager.clean_old_backups(). These tests verify the BackupManager's
# cleanup correctly handles orphaned files and missing files based on the
# state of self.backups *when it is called*.
