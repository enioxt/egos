# Work Title: MCP Renaming: DIAGENIO-DiagnosticTool to PRISM-SystemAnalyzer

**Date:** 2025-05-25
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Roadmap IDs:** MCP-DOC-STD-01

## 1. Objective

To rename the "DIAGENIO-DiagnosticTool" MCP to "PRISM-SystemAnalyzer" to provide a more commercial and institutional name that better reflects its purpose within the EGOS ecosystem.

## 2. Context

During the standardization of MCP Product Briefs, it was noted that the name "DIAGENIO-DiagnosticTool" was a temporary placeholder to facilitate file location within the system. A more appropriate, commercial name is required that better represents the MCP's functionality and position within the EGOS ecosystem.

## 3. Tasks to Complete

- ✅ Create new file `PRISM-SystemAnalyzer_Product_Brief.md` with updated content
- ✅ Update all internal references within the file to reflect the new name
- ✅ Update the MCP Identifier URN to `urn:egos:mcp:prism:systemanalyzer:0.1.0`
- ✅ Update references to this MCP in other Product Briefs:
  - Updated references in `CRONOS-VersionControl_Product_Brief.md`
- ✅ Update the work log `WORK_2025-05-25_MCP_Documentation_Standardization.md` to reflect this change
- ⬜ Remove the old file `DIAGENIO-DiagnosticTool_Product_Brief.md` once all references are updated
- ⬜ Update ROADMAP.md if necessary

## 4. Implementation Plan

1. Create a copy of the existing file with the new name
2. Update all content in the new file to reflect the name change
3. Update cross-references in other files
4. Remove the old file once all references have been updated

## 5. References

- `C:\EGOS\docs\core_materials\standards\EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md` (MCP standards)
