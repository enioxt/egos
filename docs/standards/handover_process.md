# EGOS Project Handover Process Standard

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** EGOS System Governance

## 1. Objective

To define a standardized, robust, and comprehensive handover process for tasks, components, roles, or entire projects within the EGOS ecosystem. This standard aims to ensure continuity, minimize disruption, maintain knowledge integrity, and facilitate smooth transitions between individuals or teams (including human-to-human, human-to-AI, AI-to-human, and AI-to-AI handovers).

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to all planned handovers within the EGOS project, including but not limited to:
*   Handover of specific development tasks or features.
*   Transition of responsibility for a particular script, module, or subsystem.
*   Temporary handovers for absences.
*   Permanent handovers due to role changes or departures.
*   Handovers between human contributors and AI assistants/agents.

## 3. Core Principles

The EGOS handover process is guided by the following MQP principles:
*   **KOIOS (Standardization & Knowledge):** Ensuring all necessary information is documented and transferred in a standardized way.
*   **CRONOS (Evolutionary Preservation & Context Continuity):** Maintaining the history and context of the work being handed over.
*   **ATLAS (Systemic Cartography):** Clearly mapping out the components, dependencies, and relationships relevant to the handover.
*   **NEXUS (Conscious Modularity):** Ensuring the item being handed over is well-defined and its boundaries understood.
*   **HARMONY (Harmonious Integration):** Facilitating a smooth integration of the new owner/maintainer.

## 4. Handover Procedure

The handover process consists of several key phases and a checklist of deliverables.

### 4.1 Preparation Phase (By Outgoing Party)

1.  **Identify Scope:** Clearly define what is being handed over.
2.  **Documentation Review & Update:**
    *   Ensure all relevant documentation (READMEs, design documents, API specs, inline comments, work logs) is up-to-date, accurate, and accessible.
    *   Verify that documentation adheres to KOIOS documentation standards.
    *   Create any missing documentation critical for understanding.
3.  **Code & Artifact Review:**
    *   Ensure code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to EGOS coding standards.
    *   Verify that all project artifacts (configuration files, test scripts, deployment scripts, datasets) are organized, versioned, and accessible.
    *   Run linters, tests, and any relevant validation scripts to confirm stability.
4.  **Knowledge Capture:**
    *   Document any implicit knowledge, ongoing issues, known limitations, or "gotchas."
    *   List key contacts or subject matter experts related to the work.
    *   Summarize the current status, including any pending tasks or unresolved bugs.
5.  **Access & Permissions:**
    *   Identify all systems, tools, repositories, and resources requiring access.
    *   Prepare to transfer ownership or grant necessary permissions.
6.  **Prepare Handover Package:** Compile all documentation and relevant materials into a structured package (digital folder, wiki page, etc.).

### 4.2 Execution Phase (Joint Responsibility)

1.  **Handover Meeting(s):**
    *   Schedule dedicated time for the handover.
    *   The outgoing party walks the incoming party through the handover package, explaining key aspects, demonstrating systems/processes, and answering questions.
    *   For AI handovers, this may involve structured prompts, knowledge base updates, or specific training sessions.
2.  **Knowledge Transfer:**
    *   Discuss current status, priorities, risks, and opportunities.
    *   Review open issues, tickets, or tasks.
3.  **Access Transfer:**
    *   Transfer ownership of repositories, documents, and other resources.
    *   Ensure the incoming party has the necessary access rights and credentials (securely managed).
4.  **Shadowing/Support Period (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   The outgoing party remains available for a defined period to provide support and answer follow-up questions.
    *   For complex handovers, a period of shadowing where the incoming party takes the lead with the outgoing party observing can be beneficial.

### 4.3 Confirmation Phase (By Incoming Party)

1.  **Review & Understanding:**
    *   The incoming party thoroughly reviews all handover materials.
    *   Independently attempts to perform key tasks or navigate the system.
2.  **Clarification:**
    *   Ask any remaining questions to the outgoing party.
3.  **Acknowledgement:**
    *   Formally acknowledge receipt and understanding of the handover. This can be a signed document, an email confirmation, or an update in a task tracking system.

### 4.4 Post-Handover Phase

1.  **Monitoring:** The incoming party (and their manager/lead if applicable) monitors the transitioned responsibilities.
2.  **Feedback:** Provide feedback on the handover process itself to help refine this standard.
3.  **Update Records:** Ensure relevant system records (e.g., `CODEOWNERS` files, team directories, project management tools) are updated to reflect the new ownership.

## 5. Handover Checklist / Deliverables Template

A standardized checklist should be used for each handover. This will be maintained as a separate template document: `handover_checklist_template.md` (to be created).

**Key items typically include:**

*   [ ] **General Information:**
    *   [ ] Item/Task/Project being handed over:
    *   [ ] Outgoing Person/Team/AI:
    *   [ ] Incoming Person/Team/AI:
    *   [ ] Handover Date:
    *   [ ] Reason for Handover:
*   [ ] **Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Links to all relevant READMEs:
    *   [ ] Links to design documents, architecture diagrams:
    *   [ ] Links to API specifications:

## 6. Responsibilities

*   **Outgoing Party:** Responsible for preparing thoroughly, documenting accurately, and transferring knowledge effectively.
*   **Incoming Party:** Responsible for actively engaging, asking clarifying questions, and diligently reviewing materials to ensure full understanding.
*   **Manager/Lead (if applicable):** Responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring resources are available, and facilitating a smooth transition.

## 7. Review and Updates to this Standard

This Handover Process Standard will be reviewed periodically (at least annually or as needed) and updated to reflect lessons learned and evolving project needs. Feedback can be submitted via issues in the main EGOS repository, tagged with `process-improvement` and `handover`.
