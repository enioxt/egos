# Roadmap Maintenance Procedures (KOIOS-GUIDE-003)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the standard procedures for maintaining the modular EGOS roadmap system. It provides guidelines for updating both the main roadmap and subsystem-specific roadmaps, ensuring consistency, accurate cross-referencing, and alignment with EGOS principles of Conscious Modularity and the MYCELIUM metaphor of interconnection.

## 2. General Maintenance Principles

### 2.1 Update Frequency

- **Main Roadmap**: Review and update at least quarterly, focusing on strategic goals and cross-cutting concerns.
- **Subsystem Roadmaps**: Update on an ongoing basis as tasks progress, with a formal review monthly.
- **Critical Changes**: Any change that affects multiple subsystems should trigger immediate updates to all affected roadmap documents.

### 2.2 Version Control

- Increment the version number in the metadata header when making substantial changes.
- Use semantic versioning principles:
  - Increment major version (1.0 ‚Üí 2.0) for significant restructuring
  - Increment minor version (1.0 ‚Üí 1.1) for adding new tasks or sections
  - Increment patch version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1) for minor updates or corrections
- Always update the "Last Updated" date in the roadmap header.

### 2.3 Cross-Reference Integrity

- Every roadmap file must maintain a minimum of three cross-references to other documents.
- All cross-references must use the `mdc:` prefix to ensure proper linking.
- After updating any roadmap, verify all cross-references using the cross-reference validation tool.
- Report any broken cross-references immediately for repair.

### 2.4 Integration Point Verification

- All subsystem roadmaps must include an "Integration Points" section that explicitly documents connections to other subsystems.
- Integration relationships must be bidirectional ‚Äì if Subsystem A references Subsystem B, then B must also reference A.
- Run the `scripts/review_roadmap_integration.py` tool regularly to identify and resolve integration inconsistencies.
- Integration descriptions should be consistent between related subsystems (though they may emphasize different aspects of the integration).
- Each integration point must include:
  - The subsystem being integrated with (e.g., **KOIOS:**)
  - A clear description of the integration purpose and relationship
  - Specific references to relevant documentation or roadmap entries
  - Key components involved in the integration
- Integration points must be updated when new dependencies between subsystems emerge.

## 3. Main Roadmap Maintenance

### 3.1 Adding New Strategic Goals

1. Add the goal to the appropriate section in `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Assign a unique identifier following the pattern: `[SUBSYSTEM]-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]`.
3. Create a brief description focused on the high-level objective.
4. Add cross-references to relevant subsystem roadmaps where detailed implementation will be tracked.
5. Ensure the "Subsystem Roadmaps" section includes links to all affected subsystems.

### 3.2 Simplifying Existing Tasks

When a task in the main roadmap becomes too detailed:

1. Simplify the main roadmap entry to focus on the high-level goal.
2. Move detailed implementation information to the appropriate subsystem roadmap.
3. Add a cross-reference from the main roadmap to the subsystem roadmap: `**See:** [Subsystem Roadmap - Task-ID](../../subsystems\SUBSYSTEM\ROADMAP.md#task-id)`.
4. Ensure the subsystem roadmap properly references back to the main roadmap.

### 3.3 Status Updates

1. Update task status in the main roadmap using standardized indicators:
   - ‚ö° Active (current focus)
   - ‚è≥ In Progress
   - ‚úÖ Completed
   - üõë Blocked
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused
2. Ensure status consistency between the main roadmap and related subsystem roadmaps.
3. When a task is completed in all subsystems, update its status in the main roadmap.

## 4. Subsystem Roadmap Maintenance

### 4.1 Adding New Tasks

1. Determine if the task relates to an existing entry in the main roadmap:
   - If yes, add a reference to the main roadmap task.
   - If no, consider whether it should be added to the main roadmap first.
2. Create the task in the appropriate section (Completed, In Progress, or Planned).
3. Assign a unique identifier following the pattern: `[SUBSYSTEM-ABBR]-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]`.
4. Include all required fields as specified in the template:
   - Status
   - Priority
   - Estimated completion date
   - Description
   - Sub-tasks
   - Dependencies (if applicable)
   - References

### 4.2 Updating Task Status

1. Move tasks between sections (Completed, In Progress, Planned) as their status changes.
2. Update the status indicator to reflect the current state.
3. For completed tasks:
   - Add completion date
   - Ensure all sub-tasks are marked as completed
   - Verify that any dependent tasks are updated accordingly

### 4.3 Integration Points

1. Review and update the "Integration Points" section whenever:
   - New integration with another subsystem is established
   - Existing integration patterns change
   - New cross-dependencies are identified
2. Ensure each integration point includes:
   - The subsystem being integrated with
   - A brief description of the integration purpose
   - References to relevant documentation or roadmap entries
   - Specific components involved in the integration

## 5. Cross-Validation Procedures

### 5.1 Pre-Commit Validation

Before committing roadmap changes:

1. Run the cross-reference validation tool to check all links between documents:
   ```
   python scripts/validate_cross_references.py --scope roadmaps
   ```
2. Verify visual formatting using a Markdown previewer.
3. Check consistency of task IDs, statuses, and priorities.

### 5.2 Periodic Comprehensive Review

Conduct a comprehensive roadmap review quarterly:

1. Verify all subsystem roadmaps follow the current template.
2. Check for consistency in task naming, status indicators, and prioritization across roadmaps.
3. Identify orphaned tasks (those without proper cross-references).
4. Validate that main roadmap strategic goals are properly reflected in subsystem tasks.
5. Update "Future Directions" sections based on evolving project needs.

### 5.3 Dependency Management

1. Review task dependencies across subsystems to identify potential blockers.
2. Ensure all cross-subsystem dependencies are documented in both the dependent and prerequisite tasks.
3. Update estimated completion dates based on dependency status.

## 6. Problem Resolution

### 6.1 Handling Inconsistencies

When inconsistencies are found between roadmaps:

1. Identify the source of truth based on the most recent updates.
2. Update all affected documents to align with the source of truth.
3. Document the resolution in commit messages.

### 6.2 Resolving Conflicts

For conflicts in task priorities or dependencies:

1. Consult with subsystem maintainers to determine the correct approach.
2. Update both main and subsystem roadmaps to reflect the consensus.
3. Add notes to affected tasks explaining any priority changes or dependency adjustments.
