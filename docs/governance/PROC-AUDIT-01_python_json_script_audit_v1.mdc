# Process: Python & JSON Script Audit (PROC-AUDIT-01)

**Objective:**
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all Python (.py), JSON (.json), and relevant shell scripts in the EGOS project to ensure they are functional, well-structured, appropriately located, and compliant with KOIOS/EGOS standards.

---

## Methodology
- Used automated tools (`find_by_name`, `git log`, `view_file`) to discover scripts across the project.
- Excluded non-essential directories (`.git`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, etc.).
- Focused first on core system scripts, then config/docs, then application modules, then examples.
- Assessed each file for:
  - Recency (via git log)
  - Location appropriateness
  - Structure and standards compliance
  - Need for refactor or removal

---

## Findings by Area

### 1. scripts/
- **analyze_git_history.py**: Recently updated. Refactored for docstrings, type hints, and error handling.
- **validation/validate_roadmap_tasks.py**: New/uncommitted. Validates and auto-corrects ROADMAP.md task format.

### 2. Root Config & Docs
- **config/api_keys.example.json**: Recent. Properly located.
- **docs/locales/en.json, pt.json**: Recent. Used for i18n.

### 3. egos-terminal/
- **package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.**: Standard Node.js/TS configs. Some files uncommitted.

### 4. egos_dashboard/
- **app.py, src/**: Streamlit dashboard. Model of modularity, logging, config, and i18n. Uses nats_mock for dev.

### 5. examples/
- **CrewAI templates**: Located in `examples/`, appear to be for demonstration. Recency check pending.

---

## Actions Taken
- Refactored `analyze_git_history.py` for standards alignment.
- Created this process documentation.

---

## Next Steps
1. Complete recency check on example scripts.
2. Commit refactored scripts and new documentation using Conventional Commit standards.
3. Manually review and update ROADMAP.md for KOIOS compliance.
4. Decide on handling of new/uncommitted files (e.g., validation script, egos-terminal/package.json).

---

## Notes
- This process should be repeated after major refactors or before releases.
- See KOIOS documentation for standards.
