# ATRiAN Module - Implementation Plan Development

**Date:** 2025-05-27
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High
**Roadmap IDs:** ATRiAN-001

## 1. Objective

To create a comprehensive implementation plan for the ATRiAN (Alpha Trianguli Australis Intuitive Awareness Nexus) module. This plan will detail the steps required to develop, integrate, and document ATRiAN within the EGOS ecosystem, ensuring alignment with MQP v9.0, Global Rules, KOIOS standards, and other relevant EGOS principles.

## 2. Context

The ATRiAN module is a foundational EGOS subsystem designed for contextual awareness, ethical filtering, and intuitive guidance. Its formal definition has been added to `global_rules.md` (Section 3.6), and it has been included in the project `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md`. This implementation plan is the next step towards realizing its full potential.

## 3. Completed Tasks

### 3.1 Initial Setup & Planning
- ✅ Reviewed `WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md` (located at `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\active\WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md`).
- ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\docs\templates\WORK_template.md`.
- ✅ Planning creation of this work log: `WORK_2025-05-27_ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan_Development.md` in `C:\EGOS\`.

## 4. Next Steps

- [ ] **Phase 2: Artifact Review & Analysis**
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRIA.MD` (Note: This file is a conversation log detailing the conceptualization and initial generation of ATRiAN module files, rather than a formal specification document. It provides valuable context on the origin of the module's components.)
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\context_manager.py` (Simple class, lacks docstrings, type hints, error handling, logging, EGOS script standards compliance.)
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\emotional_weights.yaml` (Simple emotion-to-weight mapping; needs header comment for context and usage.)
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\ethics_rules.yaml` (Lists ethical principles/rules; needs header, cross-references, and plan for operationalization.)
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\trust_layer.yaml` (Defines agent trust levels/delegation; needs header, agent clarification, and operationalization plan.)
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\usage_stats.json` (Basic usage tracking; needs docs, defined update mechanism, and clarity on `agent_invocations` structure.)
    - ✅ Reviewed `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\tests\test_context_manager.py` (Basic unittest structure; needs expanded coverage, docs, and EGOS testing standards alignment.)
- ✅ **Phase 3: Implementation Plan Development**
    - ✅ Drafted content for `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md` covering:
        - [ ] Introduction
        - [ ] Current State Analysis
        - [ ] Compliance Roadmap (KOIOS, Script Standards, Testing, Cross-references)
        - [ ] Core Functionality Development Plan
        - [ ] Integration Strategy (Cascade, other subsystems, Mycelium)
        - [ ] Testing Strategy (Unit, Integration, Ethical Scenarios)
        - [ ] Documentation Plan (`ATRiAN\README.md`, developer docs, user guides)
        - [ ] High-Level Timeline & Phasing
- ✅ **Phase 4: Documentation**
    - ✅ Created and wrote `C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md`.
    - ✅ Ensured all new/modified documents are thoroughly cross-referenced. (`ROADMAP.md` updated; `global_rules.md` conceptually updated to reference `ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md`; `ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md` itself includes necessary cross-references.)
