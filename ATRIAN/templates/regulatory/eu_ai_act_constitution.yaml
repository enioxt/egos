# EGOS ATRiAN - EU AI Act Ethical Constitution Template
# Version: 0.1.0
# Last Modified: 2025-06-12
# 
# Purpose:
# This ethical constitution template implements the requirements of the EU AI Act
# for prompt validation in the ATRiAN system. It extends the base constitution
# with specific principles and rules aligned with EU regulation.
# 
# Usage:
# Use this template for validating prompts that must comply with EU AI Act requirements,
# particularly when developing or deploying AI systems within EU jurisdictions.
# 
# Cross-references:
# - [Base Ethical Constitution](../base/base_constitution.yaml)
# - [EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)
