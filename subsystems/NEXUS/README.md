# 🧠 EVA & GUARANI - NEXUS Subsystem

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active (Core Logic Stable, Tests Passing)

## Overview

NEXUS (Neural Evolution and Xenial Unified System) is the modular analysis engine for the EVA & GUARANI Operational System (EGOS). Its primary responsibility is to analyze source code, understand its structure, map dependencies between components, calculate relevant metrics (like complexity), and provide suggestions for improvement.

## Role in Dynamic Roadmap Sync & EGOS Interconnection

NEXUS is responsible for:
- Analyzing dependencies and integration points for the roadmap sync and subsystem interconnection.
- Supporting refactoring efforts to ensure modular, maintainable integration.
- Collaborating with KOIOS, MYCELIUM, and other subsystems to optimize the architecture and performance of the sync mechanism.

Cross-reference: See ROADMAP.md sections "Dynamic Roadmap Sync & Mycelium Interconnection" and "Technical Implementation Plan: Dynamic Roadmap Sync (Phase 1)".

## Core Components

*   **`NEXUSCore` (`core/nexus_core.py`):** Implements the core analysis logic. It uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing (`core/ast_visitor.py`) to inspect Python code. Key functions include:
    *   `analyze_code()`: Analyzes a single file for metrics (lines, complexity) and structure (imports, functions, classes).
    *   `analyze_dependencies()`: Analyzes imports across multiple files to build a dependency graph (identifying which files import others and which are imported by others). See method docstring for detailed return structure.
    *   `analyze_workspace()`: Orchestrates the analysis of all Python files in the project.
    *   `suggest_improvements()`: Provides suggestions based on configurable thresholds (e.g., high complexity, high import count, lack of docstrings).
    *   `export_analysis()`: Exports analysis results (currently supports JSON and Markdown).
*   **`NexusService` (`service.py`):** Intended as the primary service layer for NEXUS. It initializes `NEXUSCore` with appropriate configuration and logging. Currently, its role in handling Mycelium communication needs further definition and implementation. It defines handler methods (`handle_analyze_file_request`, etc.) but doesn't yet actively subscribe them via the Mycelium interface in its `start` method.
*   **`NexusAnalyzer` (`core/analyzer.py`):** **[Review Needed/Potential Refactor]** This class currently handles direct Mycelium interactions (subscribing to topics, publishing results/events) for analysis requests and updates. This functionality might be better integrated into `NexusService` or refactored into a dedicated communication handler module to separate concerns more clearly (core analysis vs. network interaction).
*   **`CodeVisitor` (`core/ast_visitor.py`):** An `ast.NodeVisitor` subclass responsible for traversing the code's AST and extracting structural information and calculating cognitive complexity.

## Key Features

*   **AST-Based Analysis:** Provides detailed insights into code structure beyond simple text matching.
*   **Dependency Mapping:** Identifies direct import relationships between Python modules.
*   **Complexity Calculation:** Calculates cognitive complexity based on control flow, nesting, boolean operators, and jumps.
*   **Improvement Suggestions:** Offers basic refactoring and documentation suggestions.
*   **Extensible:** Designed to be potentially extended with more advanced analysis techniques.

## Integration

*   **KOIOS:** Uses `KoiosLogger` (via `get_koios_logger`) for standardized logging. Relies on KOIOS standards for structure and documentation.

### NEXUS Value Proposition vs. Other Tools

While standard linters (`pylint`, `flake8`) detect import errors and IDEs provide immediate feedback, NEXUS's dependency analysis offers unique value within EGOS:

*   **Integrated Analysis Engine:** NEXUS serves as the central analysis engine for EGOS. Its primary goal is to generate a structured *dataset* describing the workspace's dependency landscape.
*   **Structured Data for Subsystems:** This dataset (including explicit categorization of internal, external, and unresolved imports) is designed for programmatic consumption by other EGOS subsystems like ATLAS (visualization) and KOIOS (reporting/suggestions).
*   **Customization & Context:** The analysis is tailored to the specific `subsystems` structure and conventions of the EGOS project.
*   **Beyond Error Checking:** Unlike linters focused on errors, NEXUS provides a comprehensive inventory and categorization for systemic understanding and further automated processing.

*   **MYCELIUM:** Intended to interact via `MyceliumInterface`. Currently, `NexusAnalyzer` handles subscriptions and event publishing. `NexusService` defines request handlers but doesn't actively bind them yet. Requires clarification/refactoring.
    *   **[TODO: Action Item - 2025-04-03]** Clearly define the responsibility boundary between `NexusService` and `NexusAnalyzer` for Mycelium communication. Options include consolidating into `NexusService`, creating a dedicated `NexusCommunicationHandler`, or clarifying existing roles. Update relevant class docstrings and this README once decided.
*   **ATLAS:** Analysis results from NEXUS (especially dependency information) are intended to be visualized by the ATLAS subsystem.

## Current Status & Next Steps (Post-Recovery)

*   Core logic migrated from previous structure.
*   Critical test blockers resolved; all tests currently passing.
*   Dependency analysis refactored for better accuracy and structure.
*   Complexity calculation logic fixed.
*   Basic README and docstring improvements added.
*   Next steps involve:
    *   Refining/Clarifying the roles of `NexusService` and `NexusAnalyzer` regarding Mycelium interaction. **(See TODO above in Mycelium Integration section)**
    *   Implementing Mycelium request handling within `NexusService` (dependent on role clarification).
    *   Adding more detailed documentation and usage examples.
    *   Further review of AST/dependency logic for edge cases if required.

## Configuration

Configuration for thresholds (e.g., complexity) and logging is passed via a dictionary to the `NEXUSCore` constructor, typically managed and provided by `NexusService` based on its own configuration.

Example `core_config` structure (passed to `NEXUSCore`):
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "suggestions": {
      "cognitive_load_threshold_high": 50,
      "imports_threshold": 15,
      "imported_by_threshold": 10
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Example (Directly using NEXUSCore)

```python
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from subsystems.NEXUS.core.nexus_core import NEXUSCore

# Assuming project_root and a suitable logger are defined
project_root = Path('.').resolve() # Example: Current directory
logger = logging.getLogger("TestNexus")
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Minimal config
config = {
    'analysis': {
        'suggestions': {
            'cognitive_load_threshold_high': 50,
            'imports_threshold': 15,
            'imported_by_threshold': 10
        }
    }
}

# Initialize Core
nexus = NEXUSCore(config=config, logger=logger, project_root=project_root)

# Analyze the workspace
workspace_analysis = nexus.analyze_workspace()

# Export results
json_output = nexus.export_analysis(workspace_analysis, format='json')
md_output = nexus.export_analysis(workspace_analysis, format='md')

# Print suggestions
suggestions = nexus.suggest_improvements(workspace_analysis)
print("\nSuggestions:")
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"- [{suggestion['severity'].upper()}] {suggestion['file']}: {suggestion['message']}")

```

*(Note: Direct Mycelium interaction example removed pending clarification of Service/Analyzer roles)*
