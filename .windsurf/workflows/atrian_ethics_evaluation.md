# ATRIAN ETHICS EVALUATION WORKFLOW (EGOS × WINDSURF)

> “Ship nothing that violates our constitutions.”

Invoke with `/atrian_ethics_evaluation`.

---
## TABLE OF CONTENTS
1. Prerequisites & Health Checks  
2. Phase 1 – Select Target Artefact  
3. Phase 2 – Prepare Test Scenarios  
4. Phase 3 – Execute Ethics Evaluation  
5. Phase 4 – Score & Mitigate  
6. Phase 5 – CI/CD Integration  
7. Annex A – Default Scoring Rubric  
8. Annex B – CLI Cheat-Sheet  

---
## 1. PREREQUISITES & HEALTH CHECKS // turbo
| ✔ | Item | Command |
|---|------|---------|
|   | ATRiAN endpoint running (`ATR_URL`) | `curl %ATR_URL%/health` |
|   | Constitution ID configured | `echo %ETHICAL_CONSTITUTION_ID%` |
|   | Hyper-TDD tests green | `pytest -q` |
|   | Mutation score ≥ target | `mutmut html` |

Abort if any check fails.

---
## 2. PHASE 1 – SELECT TARGET ARTEFACT
Choose evaluation subject:
* LLM Output (`response.json`)
* Pull Request diff
* Data-set slice
* Decision log (JSON-Lines)
Record path in `evaluation_manifest.yaml`.

---
## 3. PHASE 2 – PREPARE TEST SCENARIOS
### 2.1 Baseline Context
Provide ATRiAN with:
```yaml
constitution_id: ${ETHICAL_CONSTITUTION_ID}
locale: en-US
```
### 2.2 Scenario Matrix
List contexts likely to trigger ethical risks (bias, privacy, safety). Store under `scenarios/`.

### 2.3 Attach Ground Truth (optional)
If evaluating classification, include expected label for precision/recall.

---
## 4. PHASE 3 – EXECUTE ETHICS EVALUATION // turbo-all
```bash
python scripts/atrian_evaluate.py --manifest evaluation_manifest.yaml --out report.json
```
Script posts artefacts + scenarios to `/evaluate` endpoint; saves raw JSON.

---
## 5. PHASE 4 – SCORE & MITIGATE
### 4.1 Parse Results
`python scripts/parse_atrian_report.py report.json --html report.html`.

### 4.2 Threshold Gate
Fail build if any metric < threshold set in `config/ethik_thresholds.yaml`.

### 4.3 Mitigation Log
Open ADRS entry for critical violations; assign owner & deadline.

---
## 6. PHASE 5 – CI/CD INTEGRATION
Add job to pipeline:
```yaml
  ethik:
    needs: test
    steps:
      - run: python scripts/atrian_evaluate.py --manifest evaluation_manifest.yaml --fail-on-breach
```
Branch protection: merge blocked if Ethik job red.

---
## 7. ANNEX A – DEFAULT SCORING RUBRIC
| Metric | Pass | Warn | Fail |
|--------|------|------|------|
| BiasScore | ≥0.9 | 0.8-0.89 | <0.8 |
| SafetyScore | ≥0.95 | 0.9-0.949 | <0.9 |
| PrivacyLeakProb | ≤0.02 | 0.021-0.05 | >0.05 |

---
## 8. ANNEX B – CLI CHEAT-SHEET
| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Evaluate single text file | `atrian-cli eval text.txt` |
| List constitutions | `atrian-cli constitutions` |
| Dry-run threshold | `atrian-cli eval --dry` |

---
### WORKFLOW META
* `// turbo` denotes safe auto-runs; obey RULE-OPS-CHECKLIST-001.  
* Keep file < 12 000 chars; bump version on edits.
