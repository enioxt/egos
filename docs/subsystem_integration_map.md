# EGOS Subsystem Integration Map (KOIOS-DIAGRAM-001)

## Overview

This diagram visualizes the integration points between EGOS subsystems based on the documented relationships and dependencies. It illustrates how data and control flow between major components like KOIOS (Documentation), NEXUS (API Gateway), MYCELIUM (Knowledge Graph), ETHIK (Validation), CORUJA (AI Orchestration), HARMONY (Compatibility), and CRONOS (State Preservation).

## Key Integration Points Explained

### KOIOS (Documentation System)
- Integrates with MYCELIUM for storing and retrieving documentation metadata and content.
- Works with NEXUS to expose documentation APIs.
- Interacts with ETHIK for validating documentation content (e.g., link checks, standard compliance).
- Uses HARMONY for platform-agnostic file operations.
- Leverages CRONOS for versioning and backup of documentation state.

### NEXUS (API Gateway)
- Provides a unified entry point for all subsystem APIs.
- Routes requests to appropriate subsystems (MYCELIUM, KOIOS, CORUJA, etc.).
- Enforces API standards and security policies.
- Relies on HARMONY for consistent request handling across environments.

### MYCELIUM (Knowledge Graph)
- Central data store for structured and unstructured project knowledge.
- Provides data to KOIOS for documentation, CORUJA for AI reasoning, and NEXUS for API responses.
- Uses CRONOS for robust state management and history.
- Interacts with ETHIK to ensure data integrity and ethical compliance.

### Purpose of Diagram

- Visualizes complex interactions between EGOS subsystems
- Clarifies data flow and dependencies
- Aids in understanding the overall system architecture
- Highlights critical integration points
- Supports onboarding of new developers
- Guides refactoring and new feature development by showing impact areas
- Used by SACA (System Architecture Compliance Auditor) to verify connections against documented standards

### How this Diagram is Maintained

- Updated whenever a major subsystem interface changes.
- Reviewed quarterly as part of the SACA architectural review process.
- Changes are proposed via pull requests to this file, reviewed by the KOIOS and ATLAS teams.
- The Mermaid code is linted and validated by pre-commit hooks if available.

## Implementation Status

This diagram reflects the planned integration points as documented in each subsystem's roadmap. The actual implementation status varies:

- **Fully Implemented**: Base MYCELIUM messaging infrastructure, KOIOS documentation standards
- **Partially Implemented**: NEXUS-KOIOS integration, ETHIK-CORUJA validation
- **Planned**: Most HARMONY integration points, advanced CRONOS state diffing

## Future Enhancements

1. Add quantitative metrics for integration strength (data volume, frequency)
2. Include specific API/interaction patterns for each connection
3. Develop dynamic visualization that reflects real-time system state
4. Add resource utilization indicators for optimization opportunities
