# üìú EGOS - Scripts Directory

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-16

**Purpose:** This directory contains utility scripts used for analysis, automation, or specific tasks within the EGOS project that don't fit neatly into the main subsystem structure.

**Guiding Principles:**

*   Scripts should be well-documented, explaining their purpose, usage, and dependencies.
*   Where applicable, scripts should leverage EGOS subsystems (like KOIOS for logging) if needed.
*   Scripts intended for frequent use might be considered for integration into a subsystem or tooling framework.

## Contents

*   `analyze_git_history.py`: A script likely used to analyze the project's Git commit history for patterns, contributor activity, or code churn. (Refer to `[KOIOS/NEXUS][DOC-HTA-USAGE-01]` in `ROADMAP.md` for documentation efforts).

---

**(Note:** Ensure scripts have necessary execution permissions and dependencies documented within the script file itself or in related project documentation.)
