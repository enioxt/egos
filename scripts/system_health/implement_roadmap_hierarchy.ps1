## Roadmap Hierarchy

This main roadmap contains high-level epics that are broken down into specific tasks in local roadmaps. For detailed implementation tasks, refer to the corresponding local roadmap files:

- [Scripts Roadmap](scripts/roadmap.md)
- [Documentation Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
- [Subsystems Roadmap](subsystems/roadmap.md)
  - [KOIOS Roadmap](subsystems/KOIOS/roadmap.md)
  - [ATLAS Roadmap](subsystems/ATLAS/roadmap.md)
  - [MYCELIUM Roadmap](subsystems/MYCELIUM/roadmap.md)
  - [NEXUS Roadmap](subsystems/NEXUS/roadmap.md)
  - [CORUJA Roadmap](subsystems/CORUJA/roadmap.md)

### Status Synchronization

Epic statuses in this main roadmap are synchronized with their child tasks in local roadmaps according to the following rules:

1. An epic is marked "Done" only when all its child tasks are complete
2. An epic is "Blocked" if any critical child task is blocked
3. An epic is "In Progress" when at least one child task is in progress

For more details on roadmap hierarchy and status synchronization, see [Roadmap Hierarchy Guidelines](docs/governance/roadmap_hierarchy.md).

# EGOS Roadmap Hierarchy Implementation Report

**Generated:** $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

## Summary

The roadmap hierarchy system has been implemented across the EGOS ecosystem, establishing clear parent-child relationships between the main roadmap and local roadmaps.

## Implementation Details

### Updated Files

The following existing files have been updated with proper cross-references:

$(foreach ($filePath in $existingFiles.Keys) {
    $fullPath = Join-Path -Path $baseDir -ChildPath $filePath
    if (Test-Path $fullPath) {
        "- [$filePath]($filePath)"
    }
})

### Created Roadmaps

The following local roadmaps have been created:

$(foreach ($dir in $directories) {
    $roadmapPath = Join-Path -Path $dir -ChildPath "roadmap.md"
    $fullPath = Join-Path -Path $baseDir -ChildPath $roadmapPath
    if (Test-Path $fullPath) {
        "- [$roadmapPath]($roadmapPath)"
    }
})

### Main Roadmap

The main ROADMAP.md has been updated with a hierarchy section that links to all local roadmaps and explains the status synchronization rules.

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Local Roadmaps**:
   - Update each local roadmap with actual tasks and priorities
   - Ensure proper parent-child relationships with the main roadmap

2. **Run Synchronization Tool**:
   ```powershell
   cd $baseDir
   python scripts\maintenance\roadmap_sync.py --base-path "$baseDir" --report-file reports/roadmap/initial_sync_report
   ```

3. **Schedule Weekly Verification**:
   ```powershell
   cd $baseDir\scripts\maintenance\automation
   .\setup_roadmap_sync.ps1
   ```
