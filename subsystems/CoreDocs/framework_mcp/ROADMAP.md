# EGOS Framework Roadmap

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-26

This document outlines the development roadmap specifically for the EGOS Framework. It focuses on the evolution of the framework's core components, features, and supporting documentation.

## Guiding Principles for Roadmap Development

-   **Alignment with MQP:** All roadmap items must contribute to the realization of the Master Quantum Prompt principles.
-   **Modularity and Iteration:** Favor incremental development and releases.
-   **Community Feedback:** Incorporate insights and needs from users and contributors.
-   **Robustness and Stability:** Prioritize a solid foundation before adding extensive new features.

## Phase 1: Genesis (Current - Q3 2025)

**Goal:** Establish the core framework structure, foundational documentation, and initial MCP implementations.

-   **FRMWK-P1-01: Core Documentation Set [COMPLETED]**
    -   Deliver initial versions of README, ROADMAP, Introduction, Philosophy, Architecture, MCP Subsystem, Getting Started, Contribution Guidelines, Code of Conduct, Archive Policy, Glossary.
-   **FRMWK-P1-02: MCP Subsystem - Basic Implementation Patterns**
    -   Define and document standard patterns for creating MCP servers (FastAPI examples as a baseline).
    -   Provide template/skeleton for new MCP development.
-   **FRMWK-P1-03: ETHIK MCP - Framework Integration**
    -   Design how the ETHIK-MCP will provide ethical validation services *to the framework itself* and to applications built upon it.
    -   Initial prototype of ETHIK-MCP hooks within core framework operations.
    -   **Key Service Provider:** ATRiAN's EaaS API (`C:/EGOS/ATRiAN/eaas_api.py`) is the designated service for providing the core ethical assessment logic for the ETHIK-MCP.
-   **FRMWK-P1-04: Agent Abstraction Layer - Initial Design**
    -   Define the basic interfaces and lifecycle for agents operating within the framework.
-   **FRMWK-P1-05: Technology Stack Recommendations**
    -   Document initial recommendations for a reference technology stack (e.g., Python, FastAPI, NATS for messaging, Vector DB for knowledge) while emphasizing future agnosticism.
-   **FRMWK-P1-06: Example - "Hello World" Agent**
    -   Create a very simple example agent using the framework to demonstrate basic principles.

## Phase 2: Emergence (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

**Goal:** Enhance core components, expand MCP capabilities, and introduce more sophisticated agent tooling.

-   **FRMWK-P2-01: Core Engine - Event Bus & State Management**
    -   Implement a robust internal event bus (e.g., based on NATS or similar).
    -   Design and implement a flexible state management solution for agents and framework components.
-   **FRMWK-P2-02: MYCELIUM-MCP - Framework-Level Integration**
    -   Integrate MYCELIUM-MCP as the primary inter-agent and inter-component communication backbone.
-   **FRMWK-P2-03: NEXUS-MCP - Knowledge Graph Integration**
    -   Provide framework-level support for connecting to and utilizing knowledge graphs via NEXUS-MCP.
-   **FRMWK-P2-04: Advanced Agent Capabilities**
    -   Tool use and management for agents.
    -   Memory systems for agents (short-term, long-term).
-   **FRMWK-P2-05: Security Hardening**
    -   Review and enhance security aspects of the core framework and MCP communications.
-   **FRMWK-P2-06: Expanded Examples & Tutorials**
    -   Develop more complex example applications and agents.

## Phase 3: Flourishing (Q2 2026 - Q4 2026)

**Goal:** Achieve a mature, feature-rich framework that supports complex, multi-agent systems and fosters a vibrant ecosystem.

-   **FRMWK-P3-01: Agnostic Core - Pluggable Modules**
    -   Refactor core components to be more technology-agnostic, allowing for alternative implementations (e.g., different messaging systems, databases).
-   **FRMWK-P3-02: Orchestration Engine (Strategos-MCP Integration)**
    -   Develop advanced orchestration capabilities for complex agent workflows, potentially leveraging Strategos-MCP.
-   **FRMWK-P3-03: Developer SDK & CLI Tools**
    -   Create a comprehensive SDK and command-line tools to simplify development on the EGOS Framework.
-   **FRMWK-P3-04: Performance Optimization & Scalability**
    -   Focus on optimizing framework performance and ensuring scalability for large deployments.
-   **FRMWK-P3-05: Comprehensive Test Suite & CI/CD**
    -   Implement a full test suite and continuous integration/deployment pipelines for the framework itself.
-   **FRMWK-P3-06: Community & Ecosystem Growth Initiatives**
    -   Develop resources and programs to support community contributions and the growth of applications built on EGOS.

## Future Phases (Beyond 2026)

-   **Self-Adaptive & Self-Healing Capabilities**
-   **Decentralized EGOS Framework Operations**
-   **Deep Integration with EGOS Shell and UI**
-   **Cross-Platform Portability (beyond initial recommendations)**

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated regularly to reflect project progress and evolving priorities.
