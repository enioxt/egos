1.  **Roadmap Updates:** Numerous tasks added/updated in `ROADMAP.md` reflecting review findings, including documentation consolidation, technical debt, critical gaps, and strategic research.
2.  **Rule Updates:** `.cursor/rules/` files refined (`documentation_structure.mdc`, `api_design_contracts.mdc`, `python_logging.mdc`, `website_standards.mdc`, `pdd_standard.mdc`). `multi_agent_awareness.mdc` populated.
3.  **Documentation Consolidation:** Redundant files deleted (`WEBSITE_DESIGN.md`, CORUJA interaction guidelines). `GOVERNANCE.md` updated.

6.  **Review Summary:** Created the main review summary document.

**Blocked Items:**

*   Refactoring of `subsystems/ETHIK/core/validator.py` (`ETHIK-REFACTOR`) due to repeated AI edit failures.
