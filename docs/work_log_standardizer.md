# EGOS Work Log Standardizer

## Overview

The EGOS Work Log Standardizer is a powerful tool designed to ensure consistency across all work log files in the EGOS system. It handles locating, parsing, validating, reformatting, and archiving work logs according to the standards defined in the [Work Log Standardization document](C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\WORK_2025-05-23_Work_Log_Standardization.md).

This tool is a critical component of the EGOS documentation ecosystem, ensuring that all work logs follow consistent naming conventions, formatting, and content structure, which facilitates better knowledge management and retrieval.

## Key Features

- **Filename Standardization**: Converts filenames to snake_case format and ensures they follow the `WORK_YYYY-MM-DD_description.md` pattern
- **Content Validation**: Validates work log content against expected structure and frontmatter requirements
- **Deduplication**: Identifies and handles duplicate work log files
- **Reformatting**: Automatically reformats work logs to comply with standards
- **Archiving**: Moves completed work logs to the archive directory based on configurable criteria
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed Markdown reports of all actions taken
- **Dry Run Mode**: Simulates changes without modifying files
- **Integration**: Integrates with the EGOS ecosystem for system-wide monitoring and automated execution

## Installation

The Work Log Standardizer is pre-installed as part of the EGOS system. No additional installation is required.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python C:\EGOS\scripts\utils\work_log_standardizer\work_log_standardizer.py
```

This will run the standardizer with default settings, processing all work logs in the default active directory (`C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\active`).

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--active-dir PATH` | Directory for active work logs (default: `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\active`) |
| `--archive-dir PATH` | Directory for archived work logs (default: `C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\archive`) |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate changes without writing to files |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | Set the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) |
| `--no-integration` | Disable integration with other EGOS systems |
| `--register-only` | Only register with tool registry and exit |

### Examples

#### Standardize Work Logs in a Specific Directory

```bash
python C:\EGOS\scripts\utils\work_log_standardizer\work_log_standardizer.py --active-dir C:\EGOS\docs\work_logs\active\project_x
```

#### Dry Run Mode (No Changes Made)

```bash
python C:\EGOS\scripts\utils\work_log_standardizer\work_log_standardizer.py --dry-run
```

#### Verbose Logging

```bash
python C:\EGOS\scripts\utils\work_log_standardizer\work_log_standardizer.py --log-level DEBUG
```

## Integration with EGOS Ecosystem

The Work Log Standardizer is integrated with the broader EGOS ecosystem through the centralized tool integration system. This enables:

1. **Automatic Execution**: The tool can run automatically when work logs are created or modified
2. **System-Wide Monitoring**: The tool's usage and impact are monitored across the system
3. **Cross-Tool Interaction**: The tool can interact with other EGOS tools like the Script Ecosystem Analyzer

### Running via the Centralized Tool Runner

```bash
python C:\EGOS\run_tools.py --run work_log_standardizer
```

## Work Log Standards

The Work Log Standardizer enforces the following standards:

### Filename Format

Work log filenames must follow the pattern: `WORK_YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`

- `WORK_` is the required prefix
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date in ISO format
- `description` is a snake_case description of the work log content
- `.md` is the required file extension

Example: `WORK_2025-05-27_script_ecosystem_analyzer_implementation.md`

### Frontmatter Requirements

Each work log must include YAML frontmatter with the following fields:

```yaml
---
title: Work Log Title
date: 2025-05-27
author: Author Name
status: In Progress  # In Progress, Completed, Archived
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

### Content Structure

Work logs should include the following sections:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the work
2. **Progress**: Detailed description of work completed
3. **Next Steps**: Planned future work
4. **Issues**: Any issues encountered
5. **References**: Links to related documents

## Reports

The Work Log Standardizer generates comprehensive Markdown reports of all actions taken. These reports are saved to:

```
C:\EGOS\docs\reports\work_logs\work_log_standardization_report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md
```

The reports include:

- Summary statistics
- Validation issues found
- Reformatting failures
- Duplicates handled
- Filenames standardized
- Files archived

## Logs

Detailed logs are saved to:

```
C:\EGOS\logs\work_log_standardizer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

These logs contain all actions taken by the tool, including:

- Files processed
- Validation results
- Standardization actions
- Archiving operations
- Errors encountered

## Examples of Standardized Work Logs

### Before Standardization

Filename: `WORK_2025-05-27_Test_Work_Log.md`

```markdown
---
title: Test Work Log
date: 2025-05-27
---

# Test Work Log

This is a test work log with minimal content.
```

### After Standardization

Filename: `WORK_2025-05-27_test_work_log.md`

```markdown
---
title: Test Work Log
date: 2025-05-27
author: EGOS System
status: In Progress
tags:
  - test
  - standardization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "File not found" error

Ensure the specified active directory exists and contains work log files.

#### "Permission denied" error

Ensure you have write permissions for the active and archive directories.

#### "Validation failed" message

Check the generated report for details on validation failures and how to fix them.
