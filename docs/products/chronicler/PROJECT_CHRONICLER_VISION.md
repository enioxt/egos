# Project Vision: EGOS Chronicler Module

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-04-16

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the vision for the **EGOS Chronicler Module**, an AI-powered documentation generation tool designed to analyze local codebases and produce high-quality, structured documentation. Implementation code resides in the `subsystems/KOIOS/chronicler_module` directory within the main EGOS project.

## 2. Problem Statement

Developers often struggle with:
*   Maintaining up-to-date documentation.
*   Generating comprehensive overviews for complex projects.
*   The limitations and costs of existing documentation tools (e.g., restrictive free tiers, lack of local analysis, poor output quality).
*   Tools like Doxygen require meticulous code commenting and produce functional but often aesthetically dated output.
*   Tools like CodeGuide focus on planning docs and have high subscription barriers without adequate trials.

## 3. Vision Statement

To create an intuitive, flexible, and powerful documentation generation tool integrated within the EGOS ecosystem that:
*   Analyzes local project directories specified by the user.
*   Leverages state-of-the-art AI models (via CORUJA/OpenRouter) for deep code understanding and high-quality text generation.
*   Produces visually appealing, well-organized, and accurate documentation tailored to the specific project.
*   Operates on a transparent and accessible pay-per-use model, potentially using cryptocurrency for payments.
*   Prioritizes user experience, simplicity, and developer workflow integration.

## 4. Key Features (Long-Term)

*   **Local Codebase Analysis:** Deep scanning of local directories, respecting `.gitignore` and custom exclusion rules.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Ability to analyze and document projects in various programming languages.
*   **AI-Powered Generation:** Utilizing appropriate LLMs for context understanding (high-context models) and text generation (high-quality writing models).
*   **Multiple Document Types:** Generating project overviews, API documentation, code summaries, potentially architectural diagrams, PRDs, etc.
*   **Customizable Templates:** Allowing users to define or select templates for documentation output.
*   **Visually Appealing Output:** Generating modern, navigable HTML documentation (potentially other formats like Markdown).
*   **Flexible Model Selection:** Allowing users to choose specific AI models via OpenRouter or use an automatic selection mode.
*   **Pay-Per-Use Billing:** Transparent token-based billing for AI usage.
*   **Crypto Payments:** Support for low-fee cryptocurrency payments.
*   **Potential IDE Integration:** Future integration with IDEs like VS Code/Cursor.

## 5. Target Audience

*   Individual Developers
*   Small to Medium Development Teams
*   Users of the EGOS ecosystem
*   Developers seeking alternatives to expensive or limited documentation tools.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   User adoption and satisfaction.
*   Quality and accuracy of generated documentation.
*   Positive feedback compared to competitors.
*   Successful implementation of the pay-per-use model.
