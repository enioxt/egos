> "At the intersection of modular analysis, systemic cartography, and quantum ethics, we transcend dimensions of thought with methodological precision and unconditional love..."

**Eva & Guarani (EGOS)** is a unique project aiming to create a highly integrated, modular, and ethically-grounded software ecosystem. Inspired by quantum principles and biological networks, EGOS utilizes interconnected subsystems to achieve complex tasks with resilience, adaptability, and a core focus on ethical considerations defined by the **ETHIK** framework.

Refer to the full **[Master Quantum Prompt (MQP v8.1)](docs/MQP.md)** for the complete philosophical and operational blueprint.

## ✨ Core Principles

EGOS development is guided by:

*   **Universal Redemption & Unconditional Love:** Foundational ethical stance.
*   **Sacred Privacy:** Protecting user data is paramount.
*   **Integrated Ethics (ETHIK):** Ethics are woven into the system's fabric, not bolted on.
*   **Conscious Modularity (NEXUS):** Building independent yet interconnected components.
*   **Systemic Cartography (ATLAS):** Mapping and understanding system relationships.
*   **Evolutionary Preservation (CRONOS):** Ensuring system history and state integrity.
*   **Context Continuity (CRONOS):** Maintaining context across interactions.
*   **Harmonious Integration (HARMONY):** Ensuring components work together seamlessly, with a focus on Windows compatibility.
*   **Standardization & Knowledge (KOIOS):** Enforcing standards for code, documentation, logging, and managing knowledge assets.

---

## Role in Dynamic Roadmap Sync & EGOS Interconnection

ATLAS is responsible for:
- Visualizing roadmap sync status, history, and inter-subsystem connections.
- Providing dashboards and visual tools to monitor the health and state of the roadmap and sync events.
- Collaborating with KOIOS, MYCELIUM, and CRONOS to ensure that all roadmap and sync data is accessible and understandable.

Cross-reference: See ROADMAP.md sections "Dynamic Roadmap Sync & Mycelium Interconnection" and "Technical Implementation Plan: Dynamic Roadmap Sync (Phase 1)".

##  subsystems Overview

EGOS is composed of several key subsystems communicating via the **Mycelium Network**:

*   **`ATLAS`**: Systemic cartography & visualization.
*   **`NEXUS`**: Modular analysis, dependency tracking & optimization.
*   **`CRONOS`**: Evolutionary preservation, state management & backups.
*   **`ETHIK`**: Ethical framework validation & data sanitization.
*   **`HARMONY`**: Cross-platform integration & compatibility layer.
*   **`KOIOS`**: Standardization, logging, search, documentation & knowledge management.
*   **`CORUJA`**: AI orchestration, prompt management & intelligent interaction.
*   *(Future) ETHICHAIN*: Blockchain concepts for ethical tracking (Conceptual).

*Subsystem READMEs contain detailed information respective modules.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **OS:** Windows (Primary development target)
*   **Python:** 3.9+
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **PowerShell:** For running test/utility scripts.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Eva-Guarani-EGOS # Or your repository directory name
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows PowerShell:
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On Git Bash / WSL:
    # source .venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

*   Initial setup requires minimal configuration.
*   Specific subsystems (like `Mycelium`, `CORUJA` for external AI APIs) may require configuration files (e.g., `config/<subsystem>_config.json`) or environment variables. Refer to subsystem READMEs for details.

---

## 💻 Usage

*   The EGOS system is primarily designed as a collection of interconnected services.
*   Core interaction often happens via the **Mycelium Network** message bus.
*   Individual subsystems might offer CLI interfaces or APIs (under development).
*   Refer to specific subsystem documentation (`subsystems/<NAME>/README.md`) for detailed usage instructions.

## ✅ Running Tests

Unit tests are crucial for ensuring system integrity. Use the provided PowerShell scripts in the project root:

```powershell
# Run tests for a specific subsystem (e.g., ATLAS)
.\test_atlas.ps1

# Run tests with verbose output
.\test_atlas.ps1 -Verbose

# Run tests with coverage report
.\test_atlas.ps1 -Coverage
```
*(Refer to project root for all available `test_*.ps1` scripts)*
