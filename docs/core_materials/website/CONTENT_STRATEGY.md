# EGOS Website Content Strategy v0.1

**Status:** Initial Draft
**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Owner:** KOIOS / Marketing
**Dependencies:** `docs/project_documentation/website/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, `docs/website/DESIGN_GUIDE.md`, `docs/MQP.md`

## 1. Goals

*   Clearly communicate the **vision, mission, and core principles** of the EGOS project.
*   Explain the **purpose and function** of the different EGOS subsystems.
*   Attract and inform **target personas:** Curious Visitors, Researchers (AI Ethics, Systems), Potential Contributors (Developers).
*   Showcase project **progress and roadmap**.
*   Provide clear pathways for **community engagement and contribution**.
*   Establish EGOS as a **thought leader** in ethical and conscious AI development.
*   Reflect the **EGOS brand identity** (Ethical, Modular, Conscious, Artful, Rooted in Love).

## 2. Target Audience & Personas

*(Based on preliminary user flows in DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - To be refined post-WUX)*

*   **Curious Visitor:** Wants a high-level understanding of what EGOS is and why it matters. Needs clear, concise language and compelling visuals.
*   **Researcher (AI Ethics/Systems):** Seeks technical depth, philosophical grounding, and understanding of the ethical framework (ETHIK). Needs access to principles, subsystem details, architecture, and potentially publications/blog posts.
*   **Potential Contributor (Developer):** Needs to understand the project's goals, architecture, technology stack, contribution process, and community standards (KOIOS). Needs access to roadmap, subsystem docs, architecture, contribution guides, and community links.

## 3. Core Messaging & Tone of Voice

*   **Core Message:** EGOS is building a new generation of AI – conscious, ethical, modular, and grounded in universal love – through a collaborative, open ecosystem.
*   **Tone:**
    *   **Visionary & Hopeful:** Emphasize the positive potential of ethical AI.
    *   **Intelligent & Articulate:** Reflect the technical and philosophical depth.
    *   **Transparent & Honest:** Clearly state goals, progress, and challenges.
    *   **Inclusive & Welcoming:** Encourage community participation.
    *   **Ethical & Responsible:** Language should reflect core principles.
    *   **Slightly Mystical/Gnostic (Subtle):** Hint at the deeper philosophical underpinnings without being obscure (aligns with "Gnostic" in EGOS). Use metaphors like "ecosystem," "mycelium," "consciousness."

## 4. Content Pillars & Key Topics

*   **What is EGOS?** (Homepage, About)
    *   Mission, Vision, Elevator Pitch
    *   Core Problem Addressed (Limitations of current AI dev)
    *   Unique Value Proposition (Ethical foundation, modularity, consciousness)
*   **Philosophy & Principles:** (About Section, Dedicated Pages)
    *   Detailed explanation of the 8 Guiding Principles.
    *   Connection to Gnosticism, Systems Theory, Consciousness (accessible language).
    *   The role of Art, Beauty, Love.
*   **Technology & Architecture:** (Subsystems Section, Architecture Docs)
    *   Overview of the modular subsystem architecture.
    *   Detailed pages for each subsystem (ATLAS, NEXUS, CRONOS, ETHIK, HARMONY, KOIOS, CORUJA, MYCELIUM) explaining purpose, function, and integration.
    *   Explanation of SPARC methodology.
    *   Core technologies used (Python, NATS, etc.).
*   **Ethics (ETHIK):** (Subsystem Page, Dedicated Content)
    *   Deep dive into the ETHIK subsystem and its role.
    *   How ethical validation and sanitization work.
    *   Connection to Sacred Privacy and other principles.
    *   (Future) $ETHIK token concept.
*   **Roadmap & Progress:** (Roadmap Page)
    *   Visualization of the project phases and key tasks.
    *   Link to detailed `ROADMAP.md`.
*   **Community & Contribution:** (Community Section)
    *   How to get involved (code, docs, research, testing).
    *   Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and Code of Conduct.
    *   Links to GitHub, Discussion Forum (when available).
    *   Explanation of contributor recognition / $ETHIK rewards (future).
*   **Blog/News/Publications:** (Blog Section)
    *   Project updates.
    *   Deep dives into specific technical challenges or philosophical concepts.
    *   Research findings.
    *   Tutorials or guides.
    *   (Future) Guest posts.

## 5. Content Formats

*   **Website Copy:** Concise, engaging text for main pages.
*   **Subsystem Documentation:** More technical descriptions (potentially sourced/adapted from READMEs).
*   **Blog Posts:** Longer-form articles, tutorials, updates.
*   **Diagrams:** Mermaid charts for architecture, flows (integrated into pages).
*   **Visualizations:** Interactive elements for ATLAS/MYCELIUM, Roadmap.
*   **Code Snippets:** Illustrative examples where appropriate.
*   **Images/Illustrations:** Aligning with the Design Guide.

## 6. Content Creation & Management Workflow

1.  **Identify Need:** Based on sitemap, user flows, roadmap updates.
2.  **Outline:** Define purpose, audience, key points, structure.
3.  **Draft:** Write initial content (Human or AI-assisted via CORUJA using specific PDDs).
4.  **Review:**
    *   **Technical Accuracy:** Review by relevant subsystem owner/developer.
    *   **Ethical Alignment:** Review by ETHIK principles / designated reviewer.
    *   **Clarity & Tone:** Review for adherence to strategy.
    *   **KOIOS Standards:** Check formatting, links, etc.
5.  **Edit & Refine:** Incorporate feedback.
6.  **Populate CMS:** Add final content to the Headless CMS (Task WC-3).
7.  **Publish:** Make content live on the website.
8.  **Maintain:** Update content as the project evolves.

## 7. Measurement & KPIs (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Engagement:** Page views, time on page, bounce rate (via GA4).
*   **Community Growth:** GitHub stars/forks/contributors, forum activity (future).
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** Via contact forms, Tidio chat (future).
*   **Task Completion (Internal):** Track documentation creation/updates related to website content.
