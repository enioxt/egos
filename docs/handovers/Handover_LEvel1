EGOS AutoCrossRef – Handover Report
Date: 2025-06-14

1. What We Achieved in this Sprint
Cross-Reference Cleanup
• 
quick_crossref_cleaner.py
 was run to converge every file on the canonical Level-0 block.
• Script and all 
.bak
 artefacts were removed after verification.
Self-Reference Hygiene
• New script 
scripts/remove_self_crossref.py
c:\EGOS\scripts\remove_self_crossref.py

– Detects and deletes self-references that follow the Level-0 block.
– --dry preview + backup safety.
– Cleaned 61 files repository-wide.
Level-1 Automation (MVP)
• New script 
scripts/build_level1_xrefs.py

– Scans every 
.md
 file, collects in-repo links, writes a single
@references(level=1):       - path/to/neighbour.md    
block immediately after Level-0.
– Idempotent (replaces existing block → no duplication).
– Backup + --dry mode.
• First run updated 25 legacy documents; follow-up dry run shows zero drift.
Process Enforcement
• Git pre-commit hook (
.git/hooks/pre-commit
) blocks commits if Level-1 refs are missing/stale.
• Nightly workflow 
.windsurf/workflows/cross_reference_maintenance.md
 (// turbo-all)
remove_self_crossref.py
build_level1_xrefs.py
Auto-commit “chore: nightly x-ref refresh”.
Documentation Updates
• README: new section “Cross-Reference Architecture” explaining Level-0/1 scheme, tooling, and enforcement.
• ROADMAP: AUTOXREF-001 progress updated; next steps enumerated (CI enforcement, Level-2, caching, visualisation).

Progress + next steps

.bak
)
3. Immediate Next Steps (1-2 days)
CI Integration
• Add a job that executes python scripts/build_level1_xrefs.py --dry; fail the pipeline on non-zero exit code.
Backup Cleanup Policy
• Decide retention window; a simple cron job can prune 
.bak
 files older than ~14 days.
Team On-boarding
• Announce the new pre-commit hook in CONTRIBUTING.md; instruct contributors to run pip install -r requirements.txt (no extra deps right now).
4. Short-Term Roadmap (≤ 4 weeks)
Goal	Detail
Level-2 refs	Parse code imports (Python ast, JS/TS regex) to link implementation files.
Cache	Persist file mtimes in .egos/xref_cache.json → sub-second incremental runs.
Dashboard visual	Extend existing dashboard to render the Level-1/2 graph (networkx ➜ d3.js).
Test suite	Pytest smoke tests: generate refs in a temp repo and assert idempotence.
Packaging	Turn AutoCrossRef scripts into a reusable CLI (autoxref entry-point).
5. Mid-Term Vision (1-6 months)
Semantic Level-N
• Use a sentence-transformer to suggest references based on embedding similarity when explicit links/imports don’t exist.
Mycelium Integration
• Emit reference events to Mycelium → central KG; enable cross-repo analytics.
IDE Plug-in
• Windsurf/VS Code extension that highlights missing x-refs on save and shows quick-fix actions.
Ethical Gate
• ATRiAN hook: flag files that reference sensitive docs without the appropriate Level-0 ethics chain.
Performance
• Rust micro-service for ultra-fast scanning of >100 k files; callable from Python.
6. Long-Term “Super-System” Outlook (6-18 months)
• Holistic Knowledge Graph – AutoCrossRef + Mycelium form a real-time, queryable KG powering documentation search, LLM context injection, and live dependency heat-maps.
• Self-Healing Docs – On file rename/move, watchers automatically update all inbound references & commit.
• Explainability Layer – Click a node in the graph to open a generated “reference digest” summarising why two artefacts are linked (code usage, semantic similarity, citation count).
• Cross-Org Federation – Optional peer-to-peer exchange of public reference graphs between EGOS instances, enabling “federated documentation discovery”.
• Gamified Contribution – Score contributors on cross-reference quality; integrate with the EGOS dashboard leaderboard.

7. Handoff Checklist
 All scripts committed and runnable from EGOS/ root.
 Git hook present (Unix-style; Windows users may need .cmd wrapper if on native Git Bash).
 Workflow file in place; invoke with /cross_reference_maintenance.
 Documentation updated (README, ROADMAP, Cross-Reference Standard).
 Latest dry-run reports 0 pending changes.
You may now:

Merge to main.
Add the CI check.
Schedule the nightly workflow.
Ping me whenever you’re ready to tackle Level-2 or dashboard visualisation—happy to iterate!
