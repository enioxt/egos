# EGOS MVP Definition: Content Aggregator & Insight Engine

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial Draft)
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** April 5, 2025

---

## 1. Overview & Vision

* **Concept:** A SaaS application leveraging EGOS core capabilities (AI, modularity, ethics) to ingest diverse content sources (e.g., documents, web pages, code repositories), process them, and deliver structured summaries, insights, and potentially actionable recommendations.
* **Vision:** To provide users with a powerful, customizable, and ethically-aware tool for knowledge synthesis and discovery, overcoming information overload.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

* **Core Problem:** Professionals and researchers are overwhelmed by the volume of information across diverse sources (documents, articles, codebases). They spend excessive time manually reading, synthesizing, and extracting key insights.
* **Specific Pains Solved by MVP:**
  * Reduces time spent on manual summarization.
  * Provides a centralized place to process and revisit information.
  * Increases confidence in AI-generated summaries through basic ethical flagging (transparency about potential bias/sensitivity).
  * Facilitates quicker understanding of complex documents or code projects.

---

## 3. Target Audience (Initial)

* **Primary Niches:**
  * **Researchers/Academics:** Need to quickly digest papers, articles, and reports.
  * **Technical Writers/Documentarians:** Need to understand complex source material (code, specs) to produce documentation.
  * **Software Developers/Architects:** Need to quickly grasp the essence of new codebases, libraries, or technical documentation.
* **Initial Persona: "Alex the Analyst"**
  * *Role:* Works as a market analyst or researcher.
  * *Needs:* Quickly understand trends, competitor actions, and research papers from PDFs and web articles. Needs to extract key findings and potential biases.
  * *Pain Points:* Information overload, time constraints, difficulty comparing insights across sources, concern about the reliability/bias of purely AI summaries.
  * *MVP Fit:* Uses the Content Aggregator to upload PDFs and URLs, gets structured summaries, appreciates the ETHIK flagging for critical evaluation, uses search to find specific topics within processed documents.

## 4. Core Features (MVP Scope)

*List the absolute essential features needed for the initial launch.*

* **Content Ingestion (Priority for MVP v0.1):**
  * ✅ **Upload PDF Documents:** Core functionality.
  * ✅ **Process Web Article URL:** Essential for online research.
  * *(Deferred: GitHub Repo connection - more complex)*
* **Processing & Analysis (Leveraging EGOS Subsystems):**
  * Reliable text extraction from PDFs and web pages.
  * Configurable AI-powered summarization (e.g., short, medium, detailed) via CORUJA.
  * Basic keyword/topic identification (via CORUJA).
  * Basic ETHIK flagging (e.g., identifies potentially subjective/opinionated language, flags lack of source diversity if applicable - simple rules first).
* **Output & Delivery:**
  * Clean display of original source (if possible) alongside structured summary and extracted keywords.
  * Simple user dashboard listing processed documents.
  * Keyword-based search across processed summaries.
* **User Management:**
  * Secure user registration and login.
  * Basic usage limits (e.g., number of documents/month) for potential free tier.

---

## 5. Key Differentiators

* **How will this MVP stand out from existing summarization tools, RAG applications, or research platforms?**
  * *Ethical Lens (ETHIK):* Built-in awareness/flagging of potential biases or sensitive topics in summaries.
  * *Customization/Modularity (EGOS Core):* Potential for users to later customize processing pipelines (long-term vision).
  * *Transparency:* Clear indication of sources used for summaries.
  * *Integration Potential:* Designed with the EGOS ecosystem in mind (future integrations).

---

## 6. Success Metrics (MVP)

* **How will we measure the success of the initial MVP launch?**
  * *User Acquisition:* Number of sign-ups/active users.
  * *Engagement:* Frequency of use, number of documents processed.
  * *User Satisfaction:* Feedback scores, qualitative interviews.
  * *Value Proposition Validation:* Evidence that users find the unique features (e.g., ethical lens) valuable.

## 7. Technical Considerations (High-Level)

* **Architecture:** SaaS model, likely web application.
* **Key Technologies:** Python backend, relevant AI models (via CORUJA), potential vector database for search, web framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI), frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue).
* **EGOS Subsystem Reliance:**
  * **CORUJA:** Central for orchestrating AI calls (summarization, keyword extraction), managing prompts (using PDDs), and potentially selecting appropriate models.
  * **ETHIK:** Integrated into the processing pipeline to apply basic checks (bias/sensitivity flags) to ingested text and/or generated summaries. Rules will need to be defined specifically for this use case.
  * **KOIOS:** Standards will guide the development. Its search capabilities (future) will power the search over processed content. PDDs for CORUJA prompts will be stored/managed according to KOIOS principles.
  * **NEXUS/ATLAS:** Less direct involvement in the MVP's core user-facing features, but could be used internally for analyzing ingested code content if repository ingestion is added later.
  * **CRONOS:** Relevant for potential backups of user data or application state if deployed statefully.
  * **Mycelium:** Could potentially be used for internal communication between MVP microservices if that architecture is chosen, or for future integration with other EGOS tools.

## 8. Open Questions / Next Steps

* Refine target audience and personas.
* Prioritize specific content ingestion methods for v1.
* Detail the technical architecture.
* Define specific ETHIK checks for MVP scope.
* Develop initial UI/UX mockups.

---

## 9. Initial ETHIK Checks (MVP Scope)

*Goal: Provide basic transparency and awareness, not comprehensive ethical auditing.*

* **Subjectivity/Opinion Flagging:** Attempt to identify sentences or passages expressing strong opinions or subjective viewpoints rather than factual statements. (Method: Keyword analysis, potentially simple AI classification).
* **Sensitive Topic Identification (Basic):** Flag content related to predefined sensitive categories (e.g., PII patterns, potentially harmful topics) for user awareness. (Method: Keyword/pattern matching).
* **Source Diversity Awareness (Conceptual):** If multiple sources are processed for a single insight in the future, potentially flag if insights are derived predominantly from a single source or type of source.
* **AI Confidence Score (If available):** If the underlying AI model (via CORUJA) provides confidence scores for its summary, display this to the user.
* **Disclaimer:** Include a clear disclaimer stating that ETHIK checks are experimental, not exhaustive, and users should apply critical judgment.
