# NEXUS-GraphManager MCP - Product Brief

## 1. Introduction

NEXUS-GraphManager is a foundational EGOS component responsible for creating, managing, querying, and visualizing the intricate web of relationships between EGOS entities. It serves as the engine for Systemic Cartography, providing a dynamic and interactive map of the EGOS ecosystem. By representing components, data, users, processes, and their interconnections as a knowledge graph, NEXUS enables deep insights, impact analysis, and a holistic understanding of the system's structure and evolution.

**Value Proposition:**
*   **Systemic Cartography:** Provides a clear, visual, and queryable representation of the entire EGOS ecosystem and its interdependencies.
*   **Impact Analysis:** Allows developers and architects to understand the potential ripple effects of changes to any component or data model.
*   **Enhanced Discoverability:** Makes it easier to find related components, documentation, and resources within EGOS.
*   **Knowledge Unification:** Consolidates relationship information from various EGOS subsystems into a single, coherent model.
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** Enables complex queries and analyses on the EGOS structure, revealing patterns and dependencies.
*   **Foundation for Advanced AI:** The knowledge graph can serve as a rich data source for AI-driven automation, reasoning, and decision-support within EGOS.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To provide a comprehensive and interactive graph-based representation of the EGOS ecosystem.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Store and manage graph data consisting of nodes (entities) and relationships.
    *   Provide powerful query capabilities (e.g., Cypher, GraphQL-like) to explore the graph.
    *   Offer MCP tools for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving graph elements.
    *   Integrate with KOIOS for schema definitions of nodes and relationships.
    *   Integrate with CRONOS for versioning graph snapshots or significant structural changes.
    *   Facilitate data export for visualization in various tools or custom UIs.
    *   Ensure secure access to graph data and management functions via GUARDIAN.

## 3. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Storage and management of graph data (nodes, relationships, properties).
    *   Graph query language execution.
    *   MCP tools for CRUD operations on graph elements.
    *   Schema enforcement for nodes and relationships (defined in KOIOS).
    *   Basic graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms.
    *   Data import/export capabilities (e.g., GEXF, GraphML, JSON).
    *   Integration points for real-time updates (e.g., via MYCELIUM).
    *   Access control and security for graph data.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Advanced graph analytics and machine learning (may be a separate component that *uses* NEXUS data).
    *   Natural Language Processing for graph construction (KOIOS-DocGen might feed into NEXUS).
    *   A built-in, rich graphical user interface for visualization (NEXUS provides data *for* visualization tools).
    *   Transaction management for external systems based on graph events.

## 4. Target Audience

*   **EGOS System Architects:** For understanding system design, dependencies, and planning evolution.
*   **EGOS Developers:** For discovering service interactions, data lineage, and impact of code changes.
*   **EGOS Data Analysts/Scientists:** For exploring relationships and deriving insights from EGOS operational data.
*   **EGOS Security Auditors:** For tracing access paths, data flows, and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
*   **EGOS Project Managers/Product Owners:** For visualizing project scope, component relationships, and progress.
*   **Automated EGOS Agents/Tools:** For programmatic querying and understanding of the system structure.

## 5. User Journeys

*   **Journey 1: Developer Assessing Impact of a Change**
    1.  **Goal:** Understand which services will be affected by modifying a specific API in `ServiceX`.
    2.  Developer uses `nexus.query_graph` with a Cypher-like query: `MATCH (s:Service)-[r:DEPENDS_ON]->(api:API {name: 'ServiceX.some_method'}) RETURN s.name`.
    3.  NEXUS returns a list of services that depend on that API.
    4.  Developer can further query for downstream dependencies of those affected services.

*   **Journey 2: Architect Visualizing System Components**
    1.  **Goal:** Get a visual overview of all microservices and their primary database dependencies.
    2.  Architect uses a visualization tool that connects to NEXUS.
    3.  The tool issues a query via `nexus.export_graph_data` (or repeated `nexus.query_graph` calls) like `MATCH (s:Service)-[r:USES_DATABASE]->(d:Database) RETURN s, r, d`.
    4.  The visualization tool renders the graph, allowing the architect to explore relationships interactively.

*   **Journey 3: Automated System Adding a New Component to the Graph**
    1.  **Goal:** When a new microservice `ServiceY` is deployed, its existence and dependencies are automatically registered in NEXUS.
    2.  A CI/CD pipeline, after successful deployment, calls `nexus.create_node` to add `ServiceY` with type `Service` and relevant properties.
    3.  The pipeline then calls `nexus.create_relationship` to link `ServiceY` to other services it calls or databases it uses, based on its configuration.
    4.  These updates might also be triggered by messages processed via MYCELIUM from deployment events.

## 7. EGOS Components Utilized

*   **KOIOS (DocGen & KnowledgeBase):**
    *   Defines and manages the schemas for node labels, relationship types, and their allowed properties. NEXUS enforces these schemas.
    *   Documentation for NEXUS itself and its query language will be managed by KOIOS.
*   **CRONOS (VersionControl & DataArchive):**
    *   For versioning the graph schema.
    *   For taking periodic snapshots of the graph data, allowing historical analysis or rollback.
*   **GUARDIAN (AuthManager):**
    *   Secures access to NEXUS MCP tools, ensuring only authorized users or services can modify or query the graph.
    *   May provide fine-grained access control (e.g., read-only for some, write for others).
*   **MYCELIUM (MessageBroker):**
    *   Can be used to feed real-time updates into NEXUS. For example, a service deployment event published to MYCELIUM could trigger an update in NEXUS.
*   **PRISM (SystemAnalyzer & Monitoring):**
    *   NEXUS can provide data to PRISM about graph statistics (node/relationship counts), query performance, and data consistency.
*   **ETHIK (ActionValidator):**
    *   May be consulted for policies regarding the types of relationships or data that can be stored, especially if sensitive information is inferred or represented.

## 8. Proposed Technology Stack

*   **Core Graph Database (Options):**
    *   **Neo4j:** Mature, popular, native graph database with Cypher query language. Strong community and tooling.
    *   **ArangoDB:** Multi-model database (document, graph, key/value) with AQL query language.
    *   **Amazon Neptune:** Managed graph database service (supports TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL).
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB with Gremlin API:** Multi-model database with graph capabilities.
    *   **TigerGraph:** High-performance, distributed graph database designed for scalability.
    *   **Decision Criteria:** Query language preference, scalability requirements, performance needs, operational overhead (managed vs. self-hosted), existing team skills, licensing costs.
*   **MCP Server:** Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Go, using client libraries for the chosen graph database.
*   **Query Language:** Cypher (if Neo4j), Gremlin (if Neptune/CosmosDB/TinkerPop-compatible), AQL (if ArangoDB), or a custom-defined EGOS Graph Query Language (abstracting the underlying DB's language).

## 12. Installation & Integration

*   **Deployment:**
    *   NEXUS (graph database + MCP server) will be deployed as containerized applications within the EGOS infrastructure, likely orchestrated by Kubernetes.
    *   Configuration will include database connection details, KOIOS schema endpoints, and GUARDIAN settings.
*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Initial bulk loads via scripts (Python client using NEXUS MCP tools).
    *   Ongoing updates via CI/CD processes calling MCP tools.
    *   Real-time updates via MYCELIUM messages triggering MCP tool calls.
*   **Client Access:**
    *   EGOS services or user-facing tools will use NEXUS client libraries (or direct MCP calls) to query or modify the graph, authenticated via GUARDIAN.
    *   Visualization tools will connect via `export_graph_data` or by making `query_graph` calls.

## 13. Risks & Mitigation

*   **Schema Complexity & Evolution:**
    *   **Risk:** Defining and maintaining a coherent graph schema that accurately reflects EGOS becomes overly complex.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strong governance via KOIOS. Start with a simple schema and evolve iteratively. Use versioning (CRONOS).
*   **Data Quality & Consistency:**
    *   **Risk:** Inaccurate or outdated information in the graph reduces its value.
    *   **Mitigation:** Automate updates as much as possible (CI/CD, MYCELIUM). Implement validation rules. Regular audits.
*   **Scalability of Graph Database:**
    *   **Risk:** The chosen database cannot handle the size or query load as EGOS grows.
    *   **Mitigation:** Careful selection of graph DB technology based on projected scale. Performance testing. Horizontal scaling strategies if supported.
*   **Query Complexity & Performance:**
    *   **Risk:** Users write inefficient queries that degrade performance. Complex queries are hard to write.
    *   **Mitigation:** Provide training on query language best practices. Offer pre-defined query templates. Monitor query performance. Indexing strategies in the DB.
*   **"Hairball" Graph Problem:**
    *   **Risk:** The graph becomes too dense and interconnected, making visualization and comprehension difficult.
    *   **Mitigation:** Good schema design. Tools for filtering and viewing subgraphs. Hierarchical abstractions in the graph model.
*   **Vendor Lock-in (if using proprietary DB):**
    *   **Risk:** Dependence on a specific graph database vendor.
    *   **Mitigation:** Abstract database interactions via the MCP server. Choose databases with good export capabilities. Consider open-source alternatives.

## 14. Future Enhancements

*   **Interactive Graph Exploration UI:** A dedicated web interface for non-technical users to browse and visualize the EGOS graph.
*   **Natural Language Querying:** Allow users to ask questions about EGOS in natural language, translated to graph queries.
*   **Automated Anomaly Detection:** Use graph analytics to identify unusual patterns or deviations in system structure.
*   **Predictive Impact Analysis:** More advanced AI models using the graph to predict the likelihood and scope of impacts from changes.
*   **Integration with Semantic Web Technologies:** Support for RDF, SPARQL if beneficial for interoperability with external knowledge bases.
*   **Temporal Graph Queries:** Ability to query the state of the graph at different points in time (leveraging CRONOS snapshots).
*   **Graph-Based Recommendation Engine:** E.g., recommend relevant documentation or services to developers based on their current context.
