# ATRiAN Module - Implementation Plan

**Version:** 0.2.0
**Date:** 2025-06-03
**Status:** Active Development
**Lead:** EGOS Core Team / Cascade

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the ATRiAN (Alpha Trianguli Australis Intuitive Awareness Nexus) module within the EGOS project. ATRiAN is a foundational subsystem designed to provide contextual awareness, ethical filtering, intuitive guidance, and trust management. Its core mission is to operationalize **Ethics as a Service (EaaS)** by offering a pluggable API for real-time, contextual ethical evaluations. This empowers organizations and other EGOS components to navigate complex ethical landscapes by embedding customizable ethical frameworks directly into their AI-driven processes and decision-making.

This plan is a living document, reflecting the iterative development of ATRiAN. Recent strategic inputs from `ATRiANplan.md` have emphasized market-oriented EaaS features, which are now being integrated into this technical plan.

### 1.2. Scope
This plan covers:
- Bringing existing ATRiAN artifacts into full compliance with EGOS standards (KOIOS, script standards, testing).
- Developing ATRiAN's core conceptual functionalities, including advanced EaaS capabilities.
- Implementing features such as the Ethical Risk Score and Customizable "Ethical Constitutions."
- Integrating ATRiAN with other EGOS components, including the AI Assistant (Cascade) and the ETHIK-ActionValidator MCP.
- Establishing comprehensive documentation, testing strategies, and SDKs for the module.

### 1.3. Guiding Principles
The implementation will adhere to:
- **MQP v9.0 Principles:** Sacred Privacy (SP), Integrated Ethics (IE/ETHIK), Conscious Modularity (CM), Systemic Cartography (SC), Reciprocal Trust (RT).
- **EGOS Global Rules:** Ensuring all development aligns with workspace-wide standards.
- **Design for EaaS:** Building ATRiAN as a flexible, API-first service for ethical intelligence.
- **User-Centric Customization:** Enabling organizations to tailor ethical guidance to their specific needs and values.

## 2. Current Status & Recent Progress

*(This section remains largely the same as v0.1.1, reflecting ongoing work. Specific updates related to new features will be detailed in their respective sections below and in the roadmap.)*

- **EaaS API (`eaas_api.py`, `eaas_models.py`, `eaas_persistence.py`):** Initial FastAPI server setup is complete. Endpoints for `/ethics/audit` and `/context/awareness` are defined. Basic Pydantic models for request/response are in place. Persistence layer for audit trails is conceptualized.
- **Configuration Files (`ethics_rules.yaml`, `emotional_weights.yaml`, `trust_layer.yaml`):** Initial structures defined. Parsers are under development.
- **Testing Framework:** Pytest setup is complete. Initial unit tests for core utilities are implemented. Integration test planning for API endpoints is underway.
- **Documentation:** Core `README.md` (now v1.3.0) and this `ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md` are actively maintained. KOIOS compliance is ongoing.
- **Synergy with ETHIK-ActionValidator MCP:** Initial discussions on API contracts and integration points have occurred.

## 3. Key Objectives for Next Development Cycle (v0.2.x)

1.  **Implement Ethical Risk Score Mechanism:** Design and develop the logic for calculating and returning an Ethical Risk Score via the EaaS API.
2.  **Develop Customizable "Ethical Constitution" Feature:** Implement storage, parsing, and integration of user-defined ethical frameworks.
3.  **Expand EaaS API Functionality:** Refine existing endpoints and potentially add new ones to support advanced use cases.
4.  **Begin SDK Development:** Start foundational work on Python and Node.js SDKs.
5.  **Enhance Testing:** Develop comprehensive tests for new EaaS features and use cases.
6.  **Refine ATRiAN Memory System:** Ensure it can support the storage and retrieval needs of the new features.

## 4. Core Functionality Development Plan

### 4.1. Ethical Compass & EaaS Engine
Responsible for providing ethical guidance based on configured rules, MQP principles, and customizable ethical frameworks.

**Tasks:**
-   Finalize `ethics_rules.yaml` schema and parser.
-   Develop the core rule engine logic.

#### 4.1.1. Ethical Risk Score (ERS) Calculation and Output
-   **Concept:** The ERS will be a quantifiable output (e.g., a float between 0.0 and 1.0, or a categorical scale) from the `/ethics/audit` endpoint, representing the assessed ethical risk level of a proposed action or context.
-   **Methodology:** Initial implementation may use a weighted scoring system based on:
    -   Severity of violated rules in `ethics_rules.yaml` and the active "Ethical Constitution."
    -   Number of violated rules.
    -   Contextual factors (e.g., sensitivity of data involved, potential impact).
    -   Further research may explore more advanced models (e.g., Bayesian networks, simple ML classifiers trained on hypothetical scenarios).
-   **Data Inputs:** The `/ethics/audit` request payload will need to provide sufficient context for ERS calculation (action details, involved entities, relevant data, etc.).
-   **API Response:** The ERS will be a dedicated field in the JSON response from `/ethics/audit`. The response will also include qualitative explanations and references to specific rules that contributed to the score.
-   **Development Tasks (Roadmap ID: ATRiAN-FEAT-ERS-01):**
    -   Define detailed ERS calculation logic and parameters.
    -   Implement ERS calculation within the `eaas_api.py`.
    -   Update `eaas_models.py` to include ERS in response models.
    -   Develop test cases for various ERS scenarios.

#### 4.1.2. Customizable "Ethical Constitution" Management
-   **Concept:** Allow organizations to define their own ethical principles, policies, and rules that ATRiAN will use in its assessments, in addition to or in place of default EGOS-wide rules.
-   **Storage:**
    -   Initial approach: Store as YAML or JSON files, potentially one per tenant/organization, in a secure, designated directory (e.g., `C:/EGOS/ATRIAN/config/ethical_constitutions/{tenant_id}/constitution.yaml`).
    -   Future consideration: A dedicated database for more complex management, versioning, and querying.
-   **Format:** The structure of these constitution files will need a defined schema, allowing for declaration of principles, rules (potentially with severity/weights), and references to external standards.
-   **Parsing & Integration:** ATRiAN's rule engine will need to dynamically load and integrate the active "Ethical Constitution" for the requesting entity during an audit.
-   **Versioning & Management:** Implement a basic versioning scheme for constitution files. Administrative tools or scripts will be needed for creating, validating, and updating these constitutions.
-   **Security:** Ensure access control and integrity of these custom rule sets.
-   **Development Tasks (Roadmap ID: ATRiAN-FEAT-CEC-01):**
    -   Define schema for "Ethical Constitution" files.
    -   Implement parser for these files.
    -   Modify rule engine to incorporate custom rules.
    -   Develop mechanisms for selecting and applying the correct constitution based on request context (e.g., tenant ID from API key or token).
    -   Plan for basic management utilities.

### 4.6. Mapping Illustrative Use Cases to Technical Implementation
This section outlines how ATRiAN's architecture, particularly the EaaS API, Ethical Risk Score, and Customizable Ethical Constitutions, supports diverse applications as highlighted in `ATRiANplan.md` and the `README.md`.

-   **Content Moderation (Social Media):**
    -   **Contextual Data:** Post content, user reputation, platform community guidelines (part of "Ethical Constitution").
    -   **Ethical Rules:** Rules against hate speech, misinformation, CSAM, defined in the platform's "Ethical Constitution."
    -   **ERS Application:** Score indicates severity of violation, guiding automated actions or human review prioritization.

-   **HR Recruitment (Bias Mitigation):**
    -   **Contextual Data:** Job description, anonymized candidate profiles, shortlisting criteria.
    -   **Ethical Rules:** Fairness principles, anti-discrimination laws, diversity goals defined in the company's "Ethical Constitution."
    -   **ERS Application:** Score highlights potential bias in AI-driven shortlisting, prompting review or adjustment.

-   **Autonomous Vehicle Decision (Ethical Dilemmas):**
    -   **Contextual Data:** Real-time sensor data, environmental conditions, pre-defined ethical decision trees (part of vehicle's "Ethical Constitution").
    -   **Ethical Rules:** Principles like minimizing harm, trolley problem variations.
    -   **ERS Application:** In simulated or post-hoc analysis, ERS can evaluate the ethical alignment of decisions. Real-time application is more complex and safety-critical.

-   **Healthcare - Treatment Recommendation (Patient Ethics):**
    -   **Contextual Data:** Patient diagnosis, medical history, treatment options, bioethical guidelines, patient consent status (part of hospital's "Ethical Constitution").
    -   **Ethical Rules:** Principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice.
    -   **ERS Application:** Score helps clinicians weigh ethical dimensions of AI-suggested treatments alongside clinical efficacy.

**Implementation Note:** For each use case, specific context fields in the `/ethics/audit` payload will need to be defined. The rule engine must be flexible enough to process varied contextual inputs based on the use case and the active "Ethical Constitution."
