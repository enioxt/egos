# EGOS Dashboard Unification - Feature Matrix

## Overview

This document catalogs all features across existing dashboard implementations to ensure no functionality is lost during the unification process. Each feature is categorized, prioritized, and mapped to its source implementation.

## Feature Categories

1. **Metrics & Monitoring**: System health, performance, and resource utilization metrics
2. **Diagnostics**: Tools for system diagnosis and troubleshooting
3. **Analytics**: Data analysis and visualization capabilities
4. **User Feedback**: Collection and analysis of user feedback
5. **Integration**: Connections with other EGOS subsystems
6. **Administration**: System management and configuration
7. **Visualization**: Data visualization components and capabilities
8. **Reporting**: Report generation and export functionality

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Essential core functionality, must be implemented in initial release
- **P1 (High)**: Important features needed for effective operation
- **P2 (Medium)**: Valuable features that enhance the dashboard experience
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have features that can be implemented later

## Implementation Status

- **✅ Implemented**: Feature is fully implemented in the unified dashboard
- **⏳ In Progress**: Feature implementation is currently in progress
- **📍 Planned**: Feature is planned for implementation
- **❓ Under Review**: Feature is being evaluated for inclusion
