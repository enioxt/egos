# EGOS Web Scraping Strategies & Guidelines (KOIOS Tech Radar)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-04-05
Status: Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes best practices, recommended tools, and ethical guidelines for web scraping activities within the EGOS project, derived from internal research and analysis of external resources (April 2025). It aims to provide a standardized approach, aligning with KOIOS principles and ETHIK mandates.

Web scraping can be a powerful tool for data collection (e.g., market intelligence, research for AI models), but it must be conducted responsibly and ethically.

## 2. Core Principles (ETHIK Alignment)

All web scraping activities must strictly adhere to the following:

* **Respect `robots.txt`:** Always check and obey the rules specified in the target website's `robots.txt` file.
* **Review Terms of Service (ToS):** Analyze the website's ToS. If scraping is explicitly prohibited, do not proceed.
* **Prioritize APIs:** If a public API is available for accessing the desired data, **always** prefer the API over scraping.
* **Avoid Personal Data (PII):** Do not scrape Personally Identifiable Information unless absolutely necessary for a clearly defined, ethically approved purpose, and in full compliance with relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Responsible Request Rate:** Implement appropriate delays (e.g., using `time.sleep()` in Python scripts or built-in framework features) between requests to avoid overloading the target server. Identify yourself using a clear User-Agent string if possible (e.g., `EGOS-Scraper/1.0 (+http://your-project-url)`).
* **Legal Compliance:** Ensure all scraping activities comply with copyright laws and data privacy regulations.
* **Data Usage:** Use scraped data ethically and legally. Do not republish copyrighted content without permission.

## 3. Recommended Tools

Based on performance, open-source nature, AI integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness, the following tools are recommended for different scenarios:

* **For AI Data Pipelines & Scale (High Performance):**
  * **Crawl4AI (Python):** Open-source, designed for speed and generating AI-ready data (Markdown). Supports multimodal extraction (text, images, PDF). Excellent choice when data quality and structure for LLMs are paramount.
* **For Large-Scale, Complex Scraping:**
  * **Scrapy (Python):** Mature, robust, and highly scalable framework. Excellent for complex crawling logic, data pipelines, and handling large volumes. Requires a steeper learning curve.
* **For Dynamic/JavaScript-Heavy Sites:**
  * **Puppeteer (Node.js):** Google-maintained library for headless Chrome automation. Essential for sites relying heavily on JavaScript for content rendering.
  * **Selenium (Python/Java/etc.):** Versatile browser automation tool supporting multiple browsers. Also suitable for dynamic sites and complex interactions.
  * *(Note: Use headless browsers judiciously as they consume more resources.)*
* **For Simpler Static Sites & Parsing:**
  * **BeautifulSoup (Python) + Requests (Python):** Easy-to-use combination for parsing HTML/XML from static pages obtained via HTTP requests. Excellent starting point.
* **For Post-Processing & Analysis:**
  * **Hugging Face Transformers (Python):** Leverage free, open-source AI models for cleaning, structuring, classifying, or extracting entities from scraped text data.

* **Freemium/Low-Code Tools (Use with Caution):** Tools like Octoparse, ParseHub, ScraperAPI, and Latenode offer visual interfaces but have significant limitations in their free tiers (request limits, data caps, features). They might be suitable for *very small, non-critical* tasks or initial exploration but open-source provides better long-term flexibility and scalability for EGOS.

## 4. Low-Cost Infrastructure Strategies

Leverage cloud provider free tiers for hosting and storage, but monitor usage carefully:

* **Compute:**
  * AWS EC2 (Free Tier: t2.micro/t3.micro 750 hrs/month for 12 months)
  * Google Cloud Compute Engine (Free Tier: e2-micro 1/month in specific regions)
  * Azure VMs (Free Tier: B1s 750 hrs/month for 12 months)
  * Oracle Cloud (Free Tier: 2 AMD-based VMs always free)
* **Serverless Functions (for smaller/event-driven scripts):**
  * AWS Lambda (Free Tier: 1M requests/month)
  * Google Cloud Functions (Free Tier: 2M requests/month)
  * Azure Functions (Free Tier: 1M requests/month)
* **Storage:**
  * AWS S3 (Free Tier: 5GB for 12 months)
  * Google Cloud Storage (Free Tier: 5GB Regional Storage/month)
  * Azure Blob Storage (Free Tier: 5GB for 12 months)
  * Oracle Cloud Object Storage (20GB always free)
* **Notebooks (for development/testing):**
  * Google Colab
  * Kaggle Notebooks

## 5. EGOS Implementation Notes

* Any scraping activity undertaken for EGOS must be documented, including the purpose, target site(s), tools used, and adherence to ethical guidelines.
* Results should ideally be stored in standardized formats managed by KOIOS.
* Consider building reusable scraping components/modules within relevant subsystems (e.g., a KOIOS service for market data collection).
