# ðŸ§  Notion QG Digital Structure Design

**Document ID:** EGOS-STRAT-NOTION-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-04-28  
**Status:** âš¡ Active

## Purpose

This document outlines the recommended structure for implementing a "QG Digital" (Digital Headquarters) in Notion, serving as an integrated knowledge management system and workflow hub. This design specifically addresses the needs identified in the cognitive profile analysis, supporting hyperfocus work patterns while ensuring organization, skill tracking, and integration with the EGOS ecosystem.

## Specialized Views & Features

### 1. Mission Agenda Framework

A specialized database that implements the "Mission Agenda" concept - a flexible planning approach that supports hyperfocus work patterns.

**Key Properties:**
- `Mission`: Specific objective with clear completion criteria
- `Time Horizon`: When this should be completed
- `Context`: Background information and purpose
- `Energy Type`: What kind of energy is required (Creative, Analytical, Administrative)
- `Deep Work`: Does this require hyperfocus?
- `Related Project`: Connection to Projects database
- `Priority`: (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- `Status`: (Queued, Active, Paused, Completed)

**How it differs from conventional task tracking:**
- Focuses on missions rather than tasks
- Incorporates energy type and deep work considerations
- Groups related activities based on cognitive context
- Allows for hyperfocus periods with minimal switching

### 2. QG Dashboard

A consolidated mission control center that provides a comprehensive view of the entire system.

**Components:**
- **Daily Briefing**: Current priorities and context
- **Skills in Focus**: Currently developing skills
- **Active Missions**: Current hyperfocus areas
- **Project Status**: Overview of all active projects
- **Idea Incubator**: High-potential ideas to explore
- **Learning Queue**: Resources to engage with next
- **Weekly Reflection**: Structured review prompt

### 3. Skill Portfolio Generator

A specialized view that assembles evidence of skills into presentable formats for external demonstration.

**Features:**
- Automatically compiles evidence for each skill
- Generates summary statistics (e.g., "37 commits demonstrating Systems Thinking")
- Creates exportable skill profiles with evidence links
- Identifies gaps in skill documentation

## Integration Strategies

### 1. Audio Note Integration

**Workflow:**
1. Record audio notes using a preferred mobile app (e.g., Otter.ai)
2. App auto-transcribes content
3. Automation platform (e.g., Make.com) monitors for new transcriptions
4. Transcribed content is sent to Notion "Incoming Notes" database
5. Daily processing of notes into appropriate databases

**Technical Components Needed:**
- Transcription app with API or export capabilities
- Integration platform (Make.com, n8n, Zapier)
- Notion API integration
- Processing templates

### 2. EGOS Repository Connection

**Options:**
1. **GitHub Integration**: Use GitHub + Notion integration to sync issues and milestones
2. **API-Based Sync**: Custom script that pulls EGOS repo information into Notion
3. **Manual Link System**: Consistent linking convention between Notion and GitHub

**Key Information to Sync:**
- Current roadmap status
- Active issues and their progress
- Recent commits with skill tags
- Documentation updates

### 3. Calendar Integration

**Purpose:** Create a harmonized time management approach that respects hyperfocus work patterns.

**Implementation:**
- Two-way sync between Notion and Google Calendar
- Time blocking for deep work (hyperfocus) sessions
- Project milestone visualization
- Integration with Mission Agenda Framework

### 4. Visual Thinking Tools Connection

**Purpose:** Support visualization needs for complex systems thinking.

**Options:**
- Embed Miro/Excalidraw boards directly in Notion
- Create consistent linking patterns
- Export visualizations for inclusion in documentation

5. Add connections to Skills (Systems Thinking, Architecture)
6. Schedule time to develop in next Mission Agenda

### Tracking Skill Development

1. Complete significant refactoring of NEXUS module
2. Log in Action-Skill Log with specific skills demonstrated
3. Add Git commit as evidence with skill tags
4. Note progress in Skills database, updating growth stage
5. If substantial achievement, create Case Study
6. Dashboard shows progress in related skills

### Planning with Mission Agenda

1. Review current priorities from Projects database
2. Identify next deep work focus area
3. Create Mission Agenda items grouped by cognitive context
4. Block time in Calendar for hyperfocus sessions
5. Execute missions, logging skill applications
6. Review and reflect on completion

## Maintenance & Evolution

- **Weekly Review**: Process all captures, update statuses, reflect on skill development
- **Monthly Audit**: Ensure all databases remain clean and properly linked
- **Quarterly Evolution**: Assess if structure meets current needs, adapt as necessary
