# 07. EGOS Framework Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the EGOS Framework! Your help is essential for building a robust, ethical, and innovative platform. These guidelines are adapted from the existing `C:\EGOS\CONTRIBUTING.md` and tailored for the framework's development.

## Core Philosophy for Contributions

All contributions should align with the **Master Quantum Prompt (MQP)** principles and the overall vision of the EGOS Framework: to be new, robust, agnostic, lightweight, artistic, fluid, and deeply ethical.

## How to Contribute

We welcome various forms of contributions, including but not limited to:

-   **Code:** Implementing new features, fixing bugs, improving performance, writing tests.
-   **Documentation:** Improving existing documentation, writing new tutorials or guides, translating content.
-   **MCP Development:** Designing and implementing new Model-Context-Prompt servers according to `EGOS_MCP_Standardization_Guidelines.md`.
-   **Agent Development:** Creating example agents or agent archetypes that utilize the framework.
-   **Design & Architecture:** Proposing improvements to the framework's architecture or design patterns.
-   **Ethical Review:** Providing feedback on the ethical implications of features or components.
-   **Issue Reporting:** Identifying and clearly reporting bugs or areas for improvement.
-   **Community Support:** Helping answer questions and guide new users.

## Getting Started

1.  **Familiarize Yourself:**
    *   Read the main [Framework README.md](../README.md).
    *   Understand the [Philosophy and Principles (`01_Philosophy_and_Principles.md`)](01_Philosophy_and_Principles.md).
    *   Study the [Architecture Overview (`02_Architecture_Overview.md`)](02_Architecture_Overview.md) and [MCP Subsystem (`03_MCP_Subsystem.md`)](03_MCP_Subsystem.md).
    *   Review the [Development Guide (`06_Development_Guide.md`)](06_Development_Guide.md).
2.  **Find an Issue or Propose a Change:**
    *   Check the project's issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues for the EGOS Framework repository - link to be provided when available).
    *   If you have a new idea, consider discussing it first by creating a "proposal" issue.
3.  **Set Up Your Development Environment:** Follow the conceptual steps in [Getting Started (`04_Getting_Started.md`)](04_Getting_Started.md).
4.  **Fork & Branch (if applicable for external contributions):**
    *   Fork the main EGOS Framework repository.
    *   Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`.

## Making Changes

-   **Coding Standards:**
    *   Follow existing code style (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
    *   Write clear, concise, and well-commented code where necessary.
    *   Adhere to EGOS script standardization rules for any new scripts.
-   **Documentation (KOIOS):**
    *   Update or add documentation for any changes you make. This includes docstrings, READMEs for new components, and updates to the `/docs` directory.
    *   Ensure all cross-references are accurate (`RULE-XREF-01`, `RULE-XREF-02`).
-   **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for new functionality.
    *   Ensure existing tests pass after your changes.
-   **Commit Messages:**
    *   Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow a standard format (e.g., Conventional Commits, or EGOS-specific standard if defined).
    *   Example: `feat(MCP): Add caching layer to Oracle-MCP`
    *   Example: `fix(Agent): Resolve memory leak in perception loop`
    *   Example: `docs(Framework): Clarify ETHIK integration in Architecture Overview`
-   **Ethical Considerations (IE):**
    *   Always consider the ethical implications of your contribution. If unsure, raise it for discussion.
    *   Ensure your work aligns with Sacred Privacy (SP) and other MQP principles.

## Submitting Contributions

1.  **Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR):**
    *   Push your changes to your forked repository (or your branch in the main repo if you have direct access).
    *   Create a Pull Request against the main development branch of the EGOS Framework repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR, linking to any relevant issues.
    *   Explain the "why" behind your changes, not just the "what."
2.  **Code Review:**
    *   Your contribution will be reviewed by maintainers or other community members.
    *   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make revisions based on feedback.
    *   Respond to review comments in a timely manner.
3.  **Merging:**
    *   Once approved, your contribution will be merged.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the [EGOS Framework Code of Conduct (`08_Code_of_Conduct.md`)](08_Code_of_Conduct.md). We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and respectful community.

## Questions?

If you have questions, please ask in the designated community channels (e.g., project discussions, mailing list - to be defined) or open an issue for clarification.

Thank you for helping to build the future of EGOS!
