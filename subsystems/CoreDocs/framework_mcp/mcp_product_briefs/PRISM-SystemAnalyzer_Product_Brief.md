## 0. Executive Summary
(To be filled by EGOS Team: Provide a concise overview of PRISM-SystemAnalyzer MCP, its purpose, key features, target users, and strategic importance within the EGOS ecosystem. Highlight its role in ensuring system reliability, operational efficiency, and rapid issue resolution.)

## 1. Concept & Value Proposition
### 1.1. Introduction
The PRISM-SystemAnalyzer MCP provides a standardized interface for accessing comprehensive diagnostic and operational analytics capabilities for the EGOS ecosystem. It empowers administrators, operations teams, and developers to monitor system health, diagnose issues, perform troubleshooting, and gain insights into system performance.

### 1.2. Problem Statement
(To be filled by EGOS Team: Describe the challenges in diagnosing issues in a complex, distributed system like EGOS without a centralized diagnostic tool. E.g., fragmented logs, disparate monitoring tools, difficulty in correlating events across subsystems.)

### 1.3. Proposed Solution
PRISM-SystemAnalyzer MCP offers a unified set of tools and APIs to:
*   Fetch and query logs from various EGOS components (via MYCELIUM & CRONOS).
*   Retrieve real-time and historical performance metrics.
*   Check the status and health of individual EGOS subsystems and components (via NEXUS & KOIOS).
*   Execute predefined diagnostic tests and routines.
*   Trace requests and data flows across the system.
*   Provide operational analytics and insights.

### 1.4. Value Proposition
*   **For System Administrators/Operations:** Streamlined system monitoring, faster incident detection and resolution, reduced mean time to repair (MTTR), comprehensive visibility across the EGOS ecosystem.
*   **For Developers:** Easier debugging, performance optimization insights, better understanding of system behavior and interactions.
*   **For Business Stakeholders:** Improved system reliability, reduced downtime, data-driven decision-making for system evolution.
*   **For the EGOS Ecosystem:** Enhanced stability, better resource utilization, proactive issue prevention rather than reactive resolution.

## 2. Target Personas & Use Cases
### 2.1. Primary Personas
*   **EGOS System Administrator:** Responsible for maintaining the health and performance of the EGOS ecosystem. Needs comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and diagnostic capabilities.
*   **EGOS Developer:** Building and extending EGOS components. Needs detailed insights into system behavior, performance metrics, and debugging tools.
*   **DevOps Engineer:** Responsible for CI/CD pipelines and operational efficiency. Needs integration with monitoring systems and automation capabilities.
*   **Security Operations Analyst:** Monitoring for security incidents and anomalies. Needs access to security-relevant logs and events.

### 2.2. Key Use Cases
*   **System Health Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of all EGOS components and subsystems, with customizable dashboards and alerting thresholds.
*   **Incident Investigation:** When an issue occurs, rapidly gathering relevant logs, metrics, and system state information to diagnose the root cause.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Identifying performance bottlenecks, resource constraints, and optimization opportunities across the EGOS ecosystem.
*   **Security Auditing:** Reviewing access patterns, authentication events, and security-relevant logs for potential issues.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Analyzing resource utilization trends to inform infrastructure scaling decisions.
*   **Cross-Component Tracing:** Following the path of a request or data flow across multiple EGOS components to understand system interactions.
