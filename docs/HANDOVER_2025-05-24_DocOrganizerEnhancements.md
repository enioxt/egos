  - [x] Immediate pending tasks:
    - Test with various error scenarios (DOC-ORG-00-ERR-TEST-01)
    - Implement performance improvements (DOC-ORG-00-PERF-01)
    - Begin development of duplicate folder detection (DOC-ORG-01)

## 5. Additional Information

### Script Usage

The enhanced `doc_organizer.py` script now supports the following command-line arguments:

```bash
python doc_organizer.py [--base-path PATH] [--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [--dry-run] [--report-format {markdown,text}] [--report-file PATH] [--interactive]
```

Key new features:
- `--interactive`: Enables an interactive menu after scanning, allowing users to:
  - View all empty directories (organized by parent directory)
  - Delete all empty directories at once
  - Scan again
  - Generate a detailed report
  - Exit

- Enhanced reporting:
  - Reports now include a complete list of empty directories, organized by parent directory
  - The script displays a sample of empty directories in the console output
  - Suggestions for next steps are provided if empty directories are found

### Documentation Updates

All documentation has been updated to reflect the current state and future plans:
- `README.md` in the project root now references `doc_organizer.py`
- A comprehensive README for `doc_organizer.py` has been created
- `ROADMAP.md` has been updated with detailed tasks for future development
- Work log has been created to document all changes
- Handover process standard and template have been created

### Future Development Guidance

When implementing the planned features:
1. Start with duplicate folder detection (DOC-ORG-01)
2. Build on the existing file consolidation framework (DOC-ORG-02)
3. Implement contextual analysis after consolidation (DOC-ORG-03)
4. Add actionable suggestions based on analysis (DOC-ORG-04)

Consider leveraging the existing error handling framework and interactive mode when implementing these features.
