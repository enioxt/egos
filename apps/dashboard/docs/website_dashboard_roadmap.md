# EGOS Dashboard Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the planned enhancements and long-term vision for the EGOS website dashboard. It follows the EGOS principles of Conscious Modularity, Systemic Cartography, and Evolutionary Preservation.

## Current Implementation

- Basic dashboard framework with modular components
- Mock API endpoints providing sample data
- Initial system metrics visualization
- Basic network visualization of EGOS components

## Short-Term Enhancements (Current Sprint)

- [x] Replace iframe-based dashboard with React components
- [x] Create dashboard layout components (DashboardGrid, DashboardCard)
- [x] Implement basic metrics visualization (MetricChart, ResourceUsage)
- [x] Implement network visualization (NetworkVisualization)
- [x] Create mock API endpoints for dashboard data
- [x] Add time-based filtering to network visualization
- [x] Enhance interactive controls for better UX
- [x] Implement simple state tracking for system evolution

### Completed Features (2025-05-01)

#### Enhanced Network Visualization with Temporal Features

- **Historical Data API**: Implemented API endpoints with support for time-based filtering
- **Temporal Metadata**: Added timestamps, status tracking, and relationship history to network nodes and edges
- **Interactive Time Controls**: Added time range selector and timestamp display
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Created dynamic filters based on node types and statuses
- **Error Handling**: Improved loading and error states with graceful recovery

#### Mock API Infrastructure

- **Temporal Data Storage**: Created simulated historical snapshots showing system evolution
- **Filterable Endpoints**: Implemented query parameters for timestamp, timeRange, nodeType, and nodeStatus
- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Defined proper interfaces for all API responses and component props

## Mid-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Sprints)

- [ ] Connect dashboard to actual EGOS monitoring backend
- [ ] Implement user preferences for dashboard layout
- [x] Add more detailed subsystem status reporting
- [x] Create alert system for critical issues
- [ ] Implement dashboard access controls

### Completed Mid-Term Features (2025-05-01)

#### Detailed Subsystem Status Reporting

- **Comprehensive API**: Created detailed API endpoint with rich subsystem data including metrics, alerts, and dependencies
- **Tabbed Interface**: Implemented information-dense but accessible UI with tabbed organization
- **Alert Management**: Created collapsible alert system for subsystem issues with severity classification
- **Dependency Mapping**: Added visualization of cross-subsystem dependencies and impact assessment
- **Performance Metrics**: Implemented threshold-based metric tracking with visual indicators

## Integration Plan: MYCELIUM Metrics Subsystem

### DASHBOARD-MYC-001: MYCELIUM Dashboard Integration

**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: High  
**References**:

- <!-- TO_BE_REPLACED -->
- <!-- TO_BE_REPLACED -->
- <!-- TO_BE_REPLACED -->

#### Overview

Connect the EGOS dashboard with the MYCELIUM metrics collection system to replace mock data with real-time metrics from the MYCELIUM subsystem. This integration will leverage the existing dashboard components while providing real operational data.

#### Integration Components

1. **MYCELIUM Backend (MYC-VIZ-02)**
   - Complete the metrics collection system in MYCELIUM
   - Ensure metrics capture all essential MYCELIUM operations
   - Design a stable API for metrics retrieval

2. **API Adapter Layer**
   - Create Next.js API routes that connect to MYCELIUM's metrics API
   - Transform MYCELIUM data to match dashboard component expectations
   - Implement proper error handling and fallbacks

3. **Dashboard Extensions**
   - Add MYCELIUM-specific visualization components if needed
   - Extend existing components to handle MYCELIUM's unique data attributes

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1: API Contract Definition**
   - Define data schemas for all metrics endpoints
   - Document expected formats and refresh rates
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for type safety

2. **Phase 2: Adapter Implementation**
   - Implement `/api/mycelium/metrics` endpoint
   - Connect to MYCELIUM metrics service
   - Add proper authentication and security

3. **Phase 3: Dashboard Integration**
   - Update dashboard components to use real data
   - Add MYCELIUM-specific visualizations if needed
   - Implement configuration options

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization**
   - Test with simulated load
   - Optimize refresh rates and data payload size
   - Implement caching where appropriate

#### Technical Considerations

- **Authentication**: Secure access to metrics API endpoints
- **Performance**: Minimize dashboard impact when fetching metrics
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when metrics are unavailable
- **Extensibility**: Allow for future metrics to be added easily

## Long-Term Vision

### DASHBOARD-VISION-001: Temporal Knowledge Graph Integration

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**References**:

- [MQP](..\..\reference\MQP.md) - Following Systemic Cartography
- <!-- TO_BE_REPLACED -->

#### Description

Integrate a temporal knowledge graph system for enhanced network visualization and historical tracking of EGOS subsystem relationships. This would enable advanced historical queries, relationship tracking over time, and more sophisticated search capabilities.

#### Potential Implementation: Graphiti Integration

[Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) is an open-source framework for creating and querying temporal knowledge graphs. Key advantages for EGOS include:

1. **Bi-temporal Data Model**: Track both when events occur and when they were recorded
2. **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combine semantic embeddings, keyword search, and graph traversal
3. **Incremental Updates**: Add new data without recomputing the entire graph

#### Implementation Considerations

- **Dependencies**: Requires Neo4j database setup
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium to high
- **Resource Requirements**: Database infrastructure and API layer development
- **Benefits**: Enhanced temporal tracking, advanced queries, and historical analysis

#### Alternatives

1. **Simplified In-Memory Graph**: Implement a lighter version without external dependencies
2. **Custom Time-Series Graph**: Build a purpose-specific graph model for EGOS
3. **Enhanced Current Sigma.js**: Extend current visualization with temporal capabilities

#### Next Steps

1. Complete current dashboard enhancements
2. Evaluate actual use cases requiring temporal knowledge graphs
3. Conduct prototyping with small dataset if determined necessary
4. Make final implementation decision based on resource availability and requirements

## Implementation Priorities

All implementations should follow these principles:

1. Maintain modular, extensible architecture
2. Ensure responsive and accessible design
3. Prioritize performance and efficiency
4. Document thoroughly with proper cross-references
5. Follow EGOS principles and coding standards
