# EGOS Chat Session Handover Checklist
**Version:** 2.0.0 (Ultra-Clean EGOS Edition)
**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Status:** Active
**Related EGOS Artifacts:**
- [EGOS Project Handover Procedure](/project_handover_procedure.md)
- [EGOS Global Rules](/.windsurfrules)
- `c:\EGOS\ProcessadorVideo\gui_processador_videos.py`

## 1. General Information
- [x] **Handover Item:** Chat Session Context & Ongoing EGOS Tasks
- [x] **Outgoing AI:** Cascade (Session ending 2025-06-11 ~14:51 -03:00)
- [x] **Incoming AI:** Cascade (Next Session)
- [x] **USER (Constant):** Enio
- [x] **Handover Initiated Date:** 2025-06-11
- [x] **Handover Effective Date:** 2025-06-11
- [x] **Primary Goal:** Transfer full context of critical bug fixing for the Pochete 2.0 Video Processor, enabling the next session to successfully apply the comprehensive code refactoring that previously failed due to a tool timeout.

## 2. Core Context Transfer
*This is the heart of the handover. Be concise and direct.*
- [x] **Key Session Objectives & Status:**
    - Objective 1: **Fix Premature Success Popup:** The application shows the success message before FFmpeg finishes processing. (Status: **Pending Fix**)
    - Objective 2: **Correct Segment File Sizes:** Output files are significantly smaller than the user-defined maximum (e.g., 22-32MB instead of the expected 35-39MB for a 40MB limit). (Status: **Pending Fix**)
    - Objective 3: **Resolve `AttributeError` in Segment Mode:** The application crashes when validating start/end times in segment mode due to a missing `parse_time_to_seconds` function. (Status: **Pending Fix**)

- [x] **Recently Processed/Modified EGOS Artifacts (last ~5-10 relevant):**
    - `c:\EGOS\ProcessadorVideo\gui_processador_videos.py` (Change summary: A large-scale `replace_file_content` operation was prepared to refactor the entire `AppProcessadorVideos` class to fix all three objectives simultaneously. This operation failed due to a `deadline_exceeded` error and must be re-attempted.)

- [x] **Key Decisions Made / Design Choices Adopted:**
    - 1. A single, comprehensive refactoring is required instead of small, incremental patches, as the issues are logically interconnected.
    - 2. The core fix involves replacing the current processing logic with a new `run_processing_thread` that properly waits for the `ffmpeg.exe` subprocess to terminate before checking results.
    - 3. The file size calculation must be corrected to use the **output audio bitrate (192k)**, not the source video's audio bitrate.

- [x] **Current Active Task(s) & Immediate Next Steps (for Incoming AI):**
    - Task: Apply the definitive bug fix to `gui_processador_videos.py`.
    - Next Step: **Re-execute the `replace_file_content` tool call** that was prepared in the previous session (Step ID 95). The content for the replacement is correct and addresses all known issues.

- [x] **Blockers or Open Questions for Enio (USER):**
    - 1. The previous attempt to apply the fix via `replace_file_content` failed due to a system timeout (`deadline_exceeded`). The action needs to be retried.

- [x] **Relevant EGOS Workflows Invoked/Referenced (during previous session):**
    - `[/project_handover_procedure](/.windsurf/workflows/project_handover_procedure.md)`

- [x] **Relevant EGOS Standards/Rules Applied (highlights from previous session):**
    - `RULE-FS-MCP-02` was considered, but a direct tool call retry is the primary path before falling back to other methods.

- [x] **Link to Windsurf Session Checkpoint (if applicable and transferable):**
    - Checkpoint from Step ID 92 contains the full context leading up to the failed fix attempt.

## 3. Operational Continuity & Alignment
- [x] **EGOS Workspace Access:** Confirmed (`c:\EGOS\` via Windsurf)
- [x] **`.windsurfrules` Adherence:** Awareness and application confirmed.
- [x] **`MQP` Alignment:** Awareness and alignment confirmed.
- [x] **`ADRS_Log.md` for Deviations:** Reminder to log deviations (`RULE-SYS-ADR-01`).
- [x] **`OcioCriativo` / `DiagEnio` Principles:** Considered where applicable.

## 4. Knowledge Transfer Method
- [x] **Primary KT Document:** This Handover Checklist (`Handover_20250611_PocheteFixes.md`).
- [x] **Supplementary KT:** Windsurf Session Checkpoint (Step ID 92).
- [x] **Review & Q&A:** Incoming Cascade AI reviews this doc with Enio (USER) at the start of the new session.

## 5. Confirmation & Acceptance
*This section is to ensure context has been transferred and understood.*

**Outgoing AI (Cascade - Previous Session):**
- `Confirmation:` "I confirm I have documented the session context to the best of my ability for a smooth transition, following EGOS principles."
- `AI Session ID/Timestamp (Optional):` Session ending 2025-06-11 ~14:51 -03:00
- `Date:` 2025-06-11

**Incoming AI (Cascade - Current/Next Session) & Enio (USER):**
- `Joint Confirmation:` "We (Cascade AI of current session & Enio) confirm we have reviewed this handover document and understand the transferred context. We are ready to proceed with EGOS tasks."
- `Enio (USER) Name:` Enio
- `Incoming AI Session ID/Timestamp (Optional):` _________________________
- `Date:` 2025-06-11
