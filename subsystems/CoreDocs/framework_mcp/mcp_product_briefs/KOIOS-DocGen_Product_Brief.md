## 4. Model-Context-Prompt (M-C-P) Breakdown

### 4.1. Model
- **Primary LLM:** A state-of-the-art Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4 series, Claude 3 series, or a powerful open-source equivalent like Llama 3 70B if fine-tuned or prompted effectively). The model must excel at code understanding (especially Python), structured text generation (Markdown with YAML), and following complex instructions.
- **Supporting Models/Techniques (Potentially):**
    - **Code Parsers (e.g., AST - Abstract Syntax Tree parsers for Python):** To extract structural information from code (functions, classes, parameters, return types, existing docstrings) to provide more structured input to the LLM, reducing hallucination and improving accuracy.
    - **Embedding Models:** For semantic search if needing to find related documentation or code snippets to enrich context.
    - **Fine-tuning:** Long-term, the primary LLM could be fine-tuned on a high-quality dataset of EGOS code and its corresponding KOIOS-compliant documentation to improve performance and adherence to specific EGOS nuances.

### 4.2. Context
- **Source Code:** The primary input; the Python script, module, or code snippet to be documented.
- **KOIOS Standards & Templates:**
    - Content of `C:\EGOS\docs\templates\reference_templates\metadata\documentation_template.md` (for YAML frontmatter structure and fields).
    - Structural expectations derived from `C:\EGOS\scripts\cross_reference\script_template_generator.py` (e.g., standard script docstring sections like Description, Author, Date, Version, @references).
    - General principles from `C:\EGOS\docs\core_materials\standards\KOIOS_Interaction_Standards.md` (though less direct, influences tone and clarity).
    - If documenting PDDs, then `C:\EGOS\docs\core_materials\standards\KOIOS_PDD_Standard.md` and `C:\EGOS\docs\templates\reference_templates\PDD_Template.md` would be key.
- **User Configuration/Parameters:** 
    - Target output path/filename.
    - Specific KOIOS template to use (if multiple exist for different artifact types).
    - Sections to explicitly include or exclude.
    - Verbosity level for generated descriptions.
    - Mode of operation (e.g., `create_new`, `update_existing`).
- **Existing Documentation (for update mode):** The current version of the documentation file if the tool is asked to update it based on code changes.
- **Project-Level Context (Advanced):** Potentially, information about the broader EGOS project or the specific subsystem the code belongs to, to generate more contextually relevant @references or descriptions.

### 4.3. Prompt (Examples)
**Conceptual Master Prompt for Script Documentation (Simplified):**

```text
**System Role:** You are an expert technical writer specializing in generating KOIOS-compliant documentation for Python scripts within the EGOS ecosystem. Your outputs must strictly adhere to the provided standards and templates. You are meticulous, detail-oriented, and prioritize clarity and accuracy.

**Task:** Generate comprehensive Markdown documentation for the provided Python script.

**Inputs:**

1.  **Source Code (`script.py`):**
    ```python
    {{source_code_content}}
    ```

2.  **KOIOS Metadata Template (`documentation_template.md` excerpt for YAML):**
    ```yaml
    # Required Fields from template:
    # title: [Clear, descriptive title derived from script name/purpose]
    # version: [Default to 1.0.0 or extract from script if present]
    # status: [Default to 'Active' or 'Draft']
    # date_created: [YYYY-MM-DD - current date]
    # date_modified: [YYYY-MM-DD - current date]
    # authors: [Extract from script @author or default to 'EGOS Development Team']
    # description: [Concise summary of the script's purpose]
    # file_type: 'code' (for scripts)
    # scope: [Determine if 'subsystem', 'component', or 'project-wide' based on path/context, or default]
    # primary_entity_type: 'script'
    # primary_entity_name: [Script filename without .py extension]
    # tags: [Generate relevant tags like 'script', 'python', main purpose keywords]
    # --- (Optional fields like depends_on, related_to can be added if context allows)
    ```

3.  **KOIOS Script Docstring Structure (derived from `script_template_generator.py`):**
    The main script docstring should be formatted as follows:
    ```python
    """[Overall Script Description]

    [Detailed explanation of functionality, purpose, and usage.]

    Author: [Author Name(s)]
    Created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
    Version: [X.Y.Z]

    @references:
    <!-- @references: -->
    - .windsurfrules
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    - MQP.md
    - README.md
    - ROADMAP.md
    - CROSSREF_STANDARD.md

  - EGOS_Framework/docs/mcp_product_briefs/KOIOS-DocGen_Product_Brief.md
    """
    ```
    Function/Class docstrings should follow standard Python conventions (e.g., Google style, reStructuredText, or NumPy style, specify which is preferred by KOIOS if any, otherwise default to clear descriptive prose) covering purpose, arguments (with types), and return values (with types).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the Source Code:** Understand its purpose, main functionalities, inputs, outputs, and any classes or functions defined.
2.  **Generate YAML Frontmatter:** Create a YAML block at the beginning of the Markdown file. Populate all required fields from the KOIOS Metadata Template. Infer values where possible (e.g., title from script name, author from code). Use current date for creation/modification if not specified.
3.  **Generate Main Script Docstring:** Create the main script docstring as per the KOIOS Script Docstring Structure. The description should be comprehensive.
4.  **Document Functions and Classes:** For each function and class:
    a.  Write a clear docstring explaining its purpose.
    b.  List and describe all parameters/arguments, including their expected types.
    c.  Describe the return value(s), including type.
    d.  If complex, provide a brief example of usage within a code block (```python ... ```).
5.  **Formatting:** Ensure all output is valid Markdown. Use appropriate Markdown elements for headings, lists, code blocks, etc.
6.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write in clear, professional English. Be concise but thorough.
7.  **Adherence to KOIOS:** All generated content must align with the spirit and letter of KOIOS documentation standards.

**Output Format:** Return ONLY the complete Markdown content. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the Markdown document.
```

**Note:** This is a conceptual prompt. Actual implementation would involve more sophisticated templating, breaking down the task into sub-prompts for different sections (metadata, main docstring, function docstrings), and potentially iterative refinement based on LLM output. Error handling and providing context for `@references` would also need specific logic.

## 5. EGOS Components Utilized

KOIOS-DocGen will heavily rely on and interact with several key EGOS components and standards documents:

*   **KOIOS Standards & Template Documents:**
    *   `C:\EGOS\docs\templates\reference_templates\metadata\documentation_template.md`: This is the primary source for the YAML frontmatter structure and fields that KOIOS-DocGen must generate for all documentation. It defines required and optional metadata.
    *   `C:\EGOS\scripts\cross_reference\script_template_generator.py`: The output of this script (standard EGOS Python scripts) serves as a key input type for KOIOS-DocGen. The generator defines the expected script structure, including the main docstring format (Author, Created, Version, @references sections) that KOIOS-DocGen will need to parse from existing code or generate for new documentation.
    *   `C:\EGOS\docs\core_materials\standards\KOIOS_PDD_Standard.md` and `C:\EGOS\docs\templates\reference_templates\PDD_Template.md`: If KOIOS-DocGen is extended to document Prompt Design Documents (PDDs), these files will define the specific structure, YAML format, and content requirements for PDDs.
    *   `C:\EGOS\docs\core_materials\standards\KOIOS_Interaction_Standards.md`: While not a direct structural input, this document provides general principles for clarity, helpfulness, and interaction style (e.g., Smart Tips Protocol) that should inform the tone, quality, and user-centric nature of the generated documentation.

*   **EGOS Scripting Infrastructure & Ecosystem (as a consumer and potential integrated part):**
    *   **Target Scripts & Modules:** Any Python script or module within the EGOS project, especially those generated by or adhering to the standards set by `script_template_generator.py`.
    *   `C:\EGOS\config\tool_registry.json` (Potential Integration): KOIOS-DocGen, as an EGOS utility, would likely be registered in this JSON file. This makes it discoverable and executable via the standard EGOS `run_tools.py` mechanism, ensuring consistent access and management.
    *   **Logging Infrastructure (e.g., `KoiosLogger`):** If implemented as a Python-based tool within EGOS, KOIOS-DocGen would utilize the standard EGOS logging facilities (like `KoiosLogger` if available in its context, or a similar standardized logging setup) for recording its operations, errors, and informational messages.

*   **Cross-Reference System (NEXUS - Potential Future Integration):**
    *   To automatically populate or suggest accurate `@references` in generated documentation, KOIOS-DocGen might eventually need to query or interact with the NEXUS subsystem (or its underlying data/APIs). This would allow it to find relevant links to other EGOS documents, code modules, or roadmap items, enhancing the interconnectedness of the documentation.

## 6. Proposed Technology Stack

### 6.1. Core Logic
- **Programming Language:** Python (aligns with EGOS ecosystem and LLM integration libraries).
- **LLM Interaction Library:** `OpenAI Python Library` (if using OpenAI models), or other relevant SDKs like `Anthropic's SDK` for Claude, or `transformers` library from Hugging Face for open-source models.
- **Code Parsing:** Python's built-in `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) module for analyzing Python source code structure. Potentially `RedBaron` or `LibCST` for more advanced Full Syntax Tree (FST) parsing if needed for complex code analysis or modification tasks (though less likely for pure documentation generation).
- **Templating Engine:** `Jinja2` for managing and rendering complex prompt templates and for structuring the output Markdown if it involves more than simple string concatenation.
- **Configuration Management:** Standard Python libraries like `configparser` or `python-dotenv` for managing API keys, model parameters, and KOIOS-DocGen settings. Could also leverage EGOS's central `CONFIG` dictionary pattern if run as an internal script.

### 6.2. API Layer (If offered as a service)
- **Framework:** `FastAPI` (as suggested in dialogues) due to its high performance, Python type hints, automatic data validation, and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generation. This makes it ideal for creating a robust API for KOIOS-DocGen.
- **Asynchronous Task Queues:** `Celery` with `Redis` or `RabbitMQ` as a message broker (as suggested in dialogues). This is crucial for handling potentially long-running documentation generation tasks (especially for large codebases or complex LLM calls) without blocking API responses. Users could submit a job and get a job ID to query status later.
- **Web Server:** `Uvicorn` (ASGI server, standard for FastAPI).

### 6.3. Data Storage (if any for this MCP)
- **Job Queue & Results (if API with async tasks):** `Redis` could store task queue information and potentially short-lived results. For more persistent job tracking or if results need to be stored longer, a `PostgreSQL` database (as used elsewhere in EGOS, per dialogues) could be used to store job metadata, status, and links to generated documentation (e.g., if stored on IPFS or a file server).
- **KOIOS Templates/Standards Cache:** While primarily read from files, frequently accessed KOIOS templates or parsed standard definitions could be cached in memory (e.g., using `functools.lru_cache` in Python) or Redis for faster access.
- **User/API Key Management (if monetized service):** `PostgreSQL` for storing user accounts, API keys, usage quotas, and billing information.
- **Immutable Storage for Generated Docs (Optional, Advanced):** `IPFS` or `Arweave` (as suggested in dialogues) if there's a requirement for verifiable, immutable storage of generated documentation, especially if linked to tokenized reputation or ethical validation processes.

## 7. Monetization Strategy

### 7.1. Primary Model
- **SaaS API Subscription (for External Users/Teams):**
    - **Tiered Subscriptions:** Offer different tiers (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise) based on usage volume (number of documents generated or API calls), number of users, access to advanced features (e.g., custom template support, higher accuracy models, batch processing capabilities).
    - **Pricing:** Monthly or annual recurring revenue (MRR/ARR).
    - **Example Tiers:**
        - *Basic:* Limited documents/month, standard KOIOS templates, community support.
        - *Pro:* Higher document limits, support for custom templates, priority support, access to more powerful LLMs.
        - *Enterprise:* Custom limits, dedicated support, SLA, potential for on-premise deployment or private model fine-tuning.

- **IDE Plugin Sales/Subscription (for External Developers):**
    - **One-time Purchase:** For a specific version of an IDE plugin (e.g., for VS Code, Cursor).
    - **Subscription Model:** For ongoing updates, new features, and access to cloud-based generation capabilities (if the plugin offloads heavy processing to the SaaS API).
    - This model targets individual developers or small teams who prefer direct IDE integration.

### 7.2. Secondary/Freemium Options
- **Freemium API/Plugin Access:**
    - **Limited Free Tier:** Allow a small number of free document generations per month (e.g., 5-10 documents) using standard templates and potentially a less powerful (but still capable) LLM. This allows users to experience the value before committing to a paid plan.
    - **Watermarking/Attribution:** Free tier outputs could include a subtle watermark or attribution to KOIOS-DocGen.
- **Open Source Core with Paid Premium Features/Hosting:**
    - **Open Source CLI Tool:** Release a basic version of the KOIOS-DocGen CLI tool as open source. This builds community, encourages adoption, and allows users to self-host if they have the technical capability (and their own LLM API keys).
    - **Paid Cloud Service:** Offer the fully managed SaaS API, advanced features (e.g., sophisticated context handling, batch processing, team collaboration features), and pre-configured LLM access as the premium, paid offering.
- **Usage-Based Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG):**
    - For users with sporadic needs, offer a PAYG model for API calls beyond the free tier, billed per document generated or per token processed by the LLM. This provides flexibility.
- **Internal EGOS Value (Non-Monetary but Quantifiable):**
    - **Time Savings:** Calculate the developer hours saved by automating documentation, translating to reduced operational costs and faster project delivery within EGOS.
    - **Improved Quality & Consistency:** While harder to directly monetize, the enhanced quality and consistency of documentation contribute to easier maintenance, better onboarding, and reduced errors, which have indirect financial benefits.
    - **EgoScore/PE for Contributions:** If KOIOS-DocGen itself is an EGOS project, contributions to its development or refinement could earn EgoScore/PE for EGOS developers, aligning with the internal incentive system.

    *   Execute launch plan (see Marketing & Dissemination).

## 10. Installation & Integration

### 10.1. For EGOS Internal Use
*   **As a Python Script/Module:**
    *   **Installation:** Included directly within the EGOS monorepo (e.g., under `C:\EGOS\scripts\koios_docgen\` or a similar appropriate location for KOIOS subsystem tools).
    *   **Dependencies:** Managed via the EGOS project's main `requirements.txt` or a dedicated `requirements.txt` for the KOIOS-DocGen tool, installed into the shared virtual environment.
    *   **Configuration:** API keys for LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API key) would be managed via EGOS's standard configuration mechanisms (e.g., environment variables, central `CONFIG` dictionary loaded from a secure file).
    *   **Integration:**
        *   Callable as a Python module from other EGOS scripts.
        *   Executable as a CLI tool, potentially registered in `C:\EGOS\config\tool_registry.json` to be run via `run_tools.py`.
        *   Integrated into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically generate or update documentation for new/modified code, or to validate documentation compliance.
*   **Documentation:** Usage instructions available on the EGOS internal documentation portal.

### 10.2. For External Users (API/Plugin)
*   **SaaS API:**
    *   **Access:** Users sign up on a dedicated web portal, receive an API key.
    *   **Integration:** Standard REST API calls using `HTTPS`. Client libraries in popular languages (Python, JavaScript) could be provided for easier integration.
    *   **Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) available on the portal, along with tutorials and examples.
    *   **Authentication:** API key passed in request headers.
*   **IDE Plugin (e.g., VS Code, Cursor):**
    *   **Installation:** Via the respective IDE's marketplace (e.g., VS Code Marketplace).
    *   **Configuration:** Users would configure the plugin with their API key (if using the SaaS backend) or point to a self-hosted instance. LLM API key might be configurable if the plugin allows direct LLM interaction (less likely for a managed service).
    *   **Usage:** Typically via context menus (right-click on a file/folder/code selection) or command palette within the IDE.
*   **Self-Hosted/Open Source CLI:**
    *   **Installation:** Via `pip install koios-docgen` (if published to PyPI) or by cloning the GitHub repository and installing dependencies.
    *   **Configuration:** Users provide their own LLM API keys via environment variables or a configuration file.
    *   **Usage:** Standard command-line interface.
    *   **Documentation:** `README.md` on GitHub, `--help` flag in the CLI, and potentially a dedicated documentation site (e.g., using MkDocs, Read the Docs).

## 11. Risks & Mitigation

*   **Risk: LLM Output Quality & Consistency:**
    *   **Description:** LLMs can sometimes produce inaccurate, irrelevant, or poorly formatted documentation. Output can vary even with the same prompt.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Iteratively refine prompts, use few-shot examples, and implement structured output parsing.
        *   **Model Selection:** Use state-of-the-art models known for code understanding and generation (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus).
        *   **Temperature/Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with LLM parameters (e.g., temperature) to balance creativity and determinism.
        *   **Post-processing & Validation:** Implement rules-based checks or even secondary LLM calls to validate and correct generated documentation against KOIOS standards.
        *   **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate and report issues with generated documentation, feeding back into prompt/model refinement.

*   **Risk: LLM API Costs & Scalability:**
    *   **Description:** Heavy reliance on LLM APIs can lead to high operational costs, especially with large user bases or extensive codebases.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Efficient Prompting:** Design prompts to be concise and effective, minimizing token usage.
        *   **Caching:** Cache LLM responses for identical code snippets/prompts where appropriate (though care must be taken if context changes).
        *   **Rate Limiting & Quotas:** Implement for API users to manage usage.
        *   **Optimized Model Usage:** Use less expensive models for simpler tasks or first-pass generation, reserving more powerful/expensive models for complex sections or refinement.
        *   **Explore Fine-tuning/Self-hosting:** For very high volume, consider fine-tuning smaller open-source models or deploying them on own infrastructure (long-term strategy).

*   **Risk: Maintaining KOIOS Standard Compliance:**
    *   **Description:** As KOIOS standards evolve, KOIOS-DocGen might lag in adopting changes.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Modular Design:** Design KOIOS-DocGen to easily update its knowledge of KOIOS standards (e.g., by updating template files or configuration that the LLM uses as context).
        *   **Automated Testing:** Develop test suites that specifically check generated documentation against current KOIOS standard examples.
        *   **Versioned Standards:** Ensure KOIOS-DocGen can reference specific versions of KOIOS standards if needed.

*   **Risk: Code Parsing Complexity:**
    *   **Description:** Supporting all Python language features or complex code structures accurately can be challenging for the parser.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Robust Parsing Libraries:** Use well-maintained libraries like `ast` and potentially `LibCST` for more complex scenarios.
        *   **Focus on Common Patterns:** Prioritize support for common Python coding styles and structures.
        *   **Graceful Degradation:** If a code section is too complex to parse perfectly, aim to generate partial documentation or clearly indicate areas requiring manual review rather than failing entirely.

*   **Risk: User Adoption & Trust:**
    *   **Description:** Developers might be hesitant to rely on AI-generated documentation or find the tool disruptive to their workflow.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **High-Quality Output:** Focus relentlessly on the accuracy and usefulness of the generated documentation.
        *   **Seamless Integration:** Provide easy-to-use IDE plugins and CLI tools.
        *   **Transparency:** Be clear about the capabilities and limitations of the AI.
        *   **User Control:** Allow users to review, edit, and approve generated documentation.
        *   **Community Building & Education:** Share success stories, tutorials, and best practices.

*   **Risk: Security (API Keys, Code Exposure):**
    *   **Description:** Handling user API keys for LLMs or processing user code requires robust security measures.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure API Key Management:** Follow best practices for storing and handling API keys (e.g., encrypted storage, environment variables, secure vaults).
        *   **Data Privacy:** Clearly state data handling policies. If code is sent to a third-party LLM, ensure users are aware. For sensitive code, on-premise or private LLM solutions might be necessary (Enterprise tier).
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Protect against prompt injection or other vulnerabilities if user input directly forms part of LLM prompts.

## 12. Future Enhancements

*   **Support for More Programming Languages:**
    *   Extend parsing and generation capabilities to other languages prevalent in EGOS or popular in general (e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust).
    *   Develop language-specific KOIOS-compliant documentation templates if needed.

*   **Advanced Customization of Templates:**
    *   Allow users (especially Enterprise tier) to define and upload their own documentation templates beyond the standard KOIOS format.
    *   Provide a templating language or UI for users to customize sections, fields, and styles.

*   **Deeper EGOS Integration:**
    *   **NEXUS Cross-Reference Integration:** Automatically suggest or generate `@references` by querying the NEXUS subsystem for related EGOS artifacts (code, docs, roadmap items).
    *   **ETHIK Validation Integration:** Potentially integrate with `ETHIK-ActionValidator` to ensure generated documentation or the act of generating it adheres to ethical guidelines (e.g., regarding privacy in example code snippets).
    *   **Automated Documentation Health Checks:** Integrate with CI/CD to not only generate docs but also to score existing documentation for KOIOS compliance, completeness, and style.

*   **Interactive Documentation Generation:**
    *   A more conversational UI where the LLM can ask clarifying questions if the code is ambiguous, leading to more accurate documentation.
    *   Allow users to iteratively refine documentation sections with the AI.

*   **Batch Processing & Project-Level Analysis:**
    *   Enable generation of documentation for entire projects or directories at once.
    *   Provide a summary report of documentation status across a project.

*   **Support for Different Documentation Formats:**
    *   Output to formats other than Markdown, such as HTML (for direct web publishing), PDF, or formats compatible with documentation systems like Sphinx or Read the Docs.

*   **Visualizations & Diagrams:**
    *   Explore AI-driven generation of simple diagrams (e.g., call graphs, component relationships) from code to be included in documentation (leveraging tools like Mermaid.js or PlantUML syntax).

*   **Fine-Tuned Models for EGOS/KOIOS:**
    *   For optimal performance and adherence to EGOS-specific nuances, explore fine-tuning an open-source LLM on EGOS codebase and KOIOS-compliant documentation examples.

*   **Gamification & Incentives (External):**
    *   If an open-source version exists, reward community contributions to templates, language support, or the core engine.

*   **Integration with Version Control Systems (beyond CI/CD):**
    *   Suggest documentation updates automatically when code changes are detected in a branch (e.g., via GitHub App).
    *   Help generate commit messages or PR descriptions based on code changes and generated documentation.
