# EGOS Anomaly & Deviation Reporting System (ADRS) Log

This log tracks deviations from EGOS standards and their resolution.

| Timestamp           | Reporter          | Artifact Path/ID                     | Deviation Category | Severity | Description of Deviation                                  | Suggested Action/Notes                                  | Status | Resolver | Resolution Date | Resolution Details |
| 2025-06-15T11:28:40-03:00 | Cascade (AI) | `C:\\EGOS\\.windsurf\\workflows\\*`, `C:\\EGOS\\docs\\workflows_index.md`, `.windsurfrules` | Architectural Decision | Info | Standardized workflow front-matter (`categories`, `requires`) for all workflows and generated centralized `workflows_index.md`. | Ensure all new workflows include metadata; regenerate index via CI. | Implemented | Cascade (AI) | 2025-06-15T11:28:40-03:00 | Metadata added, index generated via script, .windsurfrules updated. |
| 2025-06-11T19:54:39-03:00 | Cascade (AI) | `EGOS Dashboard_files/`, `apps/cross_reference_system_webapp/backend` | Documentation / Orphaned Assets | Low | Obsolete static dashboard build and empty backend implementation identified. Need cleanup or archive & integration roadmap. | Recommend archiving static assets and planning integration or removal of legacy backend; update roadmap tasks accordingly. | Logged | Cascade (AI) | N/A | Investigation logged |

| 2025-06-02T20:14:30-03:00 | Cascade (AI)      | `c:/EGOS/ATRiAN/docs/market/roi_calculator/example_usage.py` | Bug Fix / Validation | Medium   | Resolved multiple `AttributeError`s (missing `sensitivity`, `cash_flows`, `cumulative_net_benefits`) and inconsistent naming (`total_benefits_npv`) in ATRiAN ROI Calculator's report export logic. Issues prevented JSON/TXT report generation for Healthcare, Manufacturing, and Retail examples, and affected cross-industry JSON. | Applied `hasattr` and `isinstance` checks for robust attribute handling. All 10 reports now generate correctly. Sanity check of Financial Services metrics indicates very high ROI/short payback, potentially due to 'Brand Value' assumptions. USER suggested color-coded terminal output for future enhancement. | Resolved | Cascade (AI) | 2025-06-02T20:14:30-03:00 | All individual and cross-industry reports verified. Financial model assumptions for Financial Services may need further review. Color-coded output logged as enhancement. |

| 2025-05-27T17:20:00-03:00 | Cascade (AI)      | `C:/EGOS/ATRIAN/docs/ATRiAN_Market_Positioning_and_GTM_Strategy.md` | File Edit Failure | High     | Multiple attempts to use `mcp2_edit_file` to populate sections 5, 6, and 8 failed due to `oldText` not matching. This occurred even after re-reading the file immediately before the edit attempt. Specific `oldText` was the placeholder content for these sections. | 1. The `mcp2_edit_file` tool seems to be unreliable for large, multi-line `oldText` replacements in this specific file, possibly due to subtle whitespace or line ending mismatches not visible in plain text. 2. Fallback to `mcp2_write_file` to replace the entire document content if targeted edits continue to fail. 3. Investigate if `mcp2_edit_file` has limitations on `oldText` length or complexity. | Logged | Cascade (AI) | N/A             | Issue identified during population of GTM strategy document. |
| 2025-05-27T14:15:00Z | Cascade (AI)      | C:\EGOS\ATRiAN\ATRiAN.md          | File Content | Medium   | ATRiAN.md contains references to `ATRIAN_TASK_FORCE_LOG.md` which does not exist. Also, the document structure could be improved with more standard Markdown (e.g., consistent heading levels, use of list items). | 1. Verify if `ATRIAN_TASK_FORCE_LOG.md` should be created or if references should be removed/updated. 2. Standardize Markdown formatting. 3. Ensure all links are valid. | Open   |          |                 |                    |
| 2025-05-27T14:10:00Z | Cascade (AI)      | C:\EGOS\ATRIAN\ATRiAN_Implementation_Plan.md | File Content | Low      | Document refers to `ATRiAN.md` using a relative path (`./ATRiAN.md`) which is acceptable but could be absolute for clarity. Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., bolding). | Consider standardizing to absolute paths for key cross-referenced documents within EGOS. Review for consistent Markdown. | Open   |          |                 |                    |
| 2025-05-27T13:50:00Z | Cascade (AI)      | C:\EGOS\PROMPTS\Templates\Example_Cascade_Prompt.md | File Content | Info     | Prompt template contains placeholder `{{CASCADE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_VERSION}}`. Ensure this is updated in actual use. | Standard procedure should be to replace placeholders. This is a template, so placeholder is expected. | Info   |          |                 |                    |
| 2025-05-27T13:45:00Z | Cascade (AI)      | C:\EGOS\README.md                  | File Content | Low      | Main README contains a link to `docs/GLOSSARY.md` which does not exist. | Create `GLOSSARY.md` or remove/update the link.        | Open   |          |                 |                    |
| 2025-05-26T00:00:00Z | Enio              | `C:\EGOS\` (Project Root)          | File System Structure | Critical | Anomalous `.git` directory present in project root.     | Investigate immediately; remove or reconfigure.         | Resolved | Enio     | 2025-05-26      | Path no longer exists; likely deleted by USER. |
| 2025-05-27T13:40:00Z | Cascade (AI)      | C:\EGOS\scripts\utils\work_log_standardizer\work_log_standardizer.py | Code Quality | Medium   | Indentation error (`IndentationError: unexpected indent`) causing script execution failure. The error occurred due to inconsistent indentation in the `run_standardization` method with unexpected indented code blocks.     | 1. Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces per level). 2. Remove duplicate code blocks. 3. Apply proper indentation flow in conditional statements. 4. Use IDE tools to visualize whitespace. 5. Document this issue in the script development standards.    | Resolved | Cascade (AI)     | 2025-05-27      | Fixed by refactoring the affected method with consistent 4-space indentation and removing duplicated code blocks. Created a more robust structure for the method flow to avoid similar issues in the future. |
| 2025-06-02T17:20:00-03:00 | Cascade (AI)      | `mcp2_edit_file` (Tool) / `c:/EGOS/ATRiAN/docs/market/roi_calculator/example_usage.py` | Tool Behavior / Precision | Medium   | `mcp2_edit_file` misapplied edits when `oldText` was not globally unique. Edits intended for one function were applied to another if the `oldText` matched an earlier section of the file. Multiple attempts (Steps 1722-1759) were needed to correct sections. Batch edits also failed if an early edit in the batch altered context for later edits (e.g., Step 1745, 1753). | 1. Use highly specific, multi-line `oldText` anchors confirmed globally unique. 2. View file content around target to confirm `oldText` uniqueness and exactness. 3. Consider separate tool calls for edits that might shift context for subsequent edits. 4. Verify all details in `oldText` (whitespace, specific values). | Logged | Cascade (AI) | N/A             | Investigation ongoing during `example_usage.py` debugging. |
| 2025-06-03T09:55:24-03:00 | Cascade (AI)      | `mcp2_edit_file` (Tool) / `C:\\EGOS\\ATRIAN\\docs\\ATRiAN_Market_Positioning_and_GTM_Strategy.md` | Tool Behavior / File Edit Failure | Medium   | `mcp2_edit_file` repeatedly failed to update Section 5 ("Competitive Landscape") due to "Could not find exact match for edit" error. Attempted to replace placeholder: "## 5. Competitive Landscape\\n\\n*(To be populated - based on ATRiANplan.md analysis: Credo AI, IBM Ethical AI, Arthur AI, Z-InspectionÂ®)*". | 1. Tool struggles with matching `oldText` for this specific block despite recent file reads. 2. If modular edits for other sections also fail, recommend using `mcp2_write_file` for the entire GTM document. 3. Proceeding with modular update attempt for Section 6 as per user request. | Logged | Cascade (AI) | N/A             | Issue encountered while populating GTM strategy document (Section 5). |
| 2025-06-09T23:53:00-03:00 | Cascade (AI) / USER | `mcp0_edit_file`, `replace_file_content` (Tools) / `C:\EGOS\.windsurfrules` | Tool Behavior / File Edit Failure | Medium   | Persistent failures attempting to edit `.windsurfrules` using `mcp0_edit_file` (due to exact match sensitivity, CRLF/LF discrepancies) and `replace_file_content` (erroneously treating file as "memory file"). Multiple attempts failed (Steps 274, 276, 279, 281). | Successfully used PowerShell via `run_command` as a fallback for inserting new sections, aligning with `RULE-FS-MCP-02`. This highlights the need for more robust AI-driven file editing tools or clearer diagnostics for existing ones when handling critical, structured configuration files. | Workaround Implemented | Cascade (AI) | `RULE-FS-MCP-02` | Issues encountered during `.windsurfrules` update session for Workflow Management and AI Session Handover rules. |
| {{CURRENT_DATETIME_ISO_8601}} | Cascade (AI)      | `C:\EGOS\.windsurfrules`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md` | Tool Behavior / Workflow | Medium   | During session updating EGOS docs: 1. `mcp0_edit_file` & `replace_file_content` remained unreliable for `.windsurfrules` due to strict matching. 2. PowerShell (`run_command`) successfully updated `.windsurfrules` & `ROADMAP.md`. 3. PowerShell faced challenges with `README.md` updates due to complex anchor matching (emojis, markdown structure). | 1. Reinforces `RULE-FS-MCP-02` (PowerShell fallback). 2. Highlights need for improved AI tool precision or better diagnostics for complex markdown. 3. Updates to `project_handover_procedure.md`, PromptVault items in `.windsurfrules`, and `ROADMAP.md` were successful. `README.md` "Core Workflows" updated; other `README.md` edits deferred. | Logged | Cascade (AI) | N/A             | Session focused on `.windsurfrules` enhancement, roadmap updates, and `README.md` workflow documentation. |
