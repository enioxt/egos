# üìö EGOS Documentation Hub

This directory serves as the central repository for all primary EGOS project documentation.

## Key Directories & Files

*   **[core_materials/](core_materials/):** Contains foundational documents, research, standards, processes, historical context, and detailed subsystem planning. Key documents within include:
    *   [MQP.md](core_materials/MQP.md): The Master Quantum Prompt (core philosophy, principles, blueprint).
    *   [PHILOSOPHY.md](core_materials/PHILOSOPHY.md): Core values and mission.
    *   [STRATEGY.md](core_materials/STRATEGY.md): High-level strategic goals.
    *   [ARCHITECTURE.md](core_materials/ARCHITECTURE.md): System architecture overview.
    *   [ai_collaboration/](core_materials/ai_collaboration/): Human-AI collaboration workflows.
    *   [ai_integration/](core_materials/ai_integration/): Guides for integrating AI tools.
    *   [standards/](core_materials/standards/): Project coding and documentation standards (KOIOS).
    *   [process/](core_materials/process/): Defined development and operational processes.
    *   [research/](core_materials/research/): Research materials, including methodologies like ToT.
    *   [website/](core_materials/website/): Planning and design documents for the EGOS public website.

*   **[process/](process/):** Contains specific, actionable process documents generated *from* core principles (often linked from `core_materials/process/`). See also [Validation Processes](core_materials/process/validation/).

*   **[templates/](templates/):** Reusable templates for documents, code structures, etc.

*   **[website/](website/):** Contains the *built* source files for a documentation site or related web output (distinct from the planning docs in `core_materials/website/`). *(Note: Confirm if this is mkdocs, jekyll, etc. source)*
