# Architecture Design: [System/Subsystem Name]

**Version:** [Version from metadata]
**Status:** [Design Status: e.g., Proposed, Draft, Approved, Implemented]

## 1. Introduction & Goals

*   **Purpose:** Briefly explain the purpose of this system/subsystem and the scope of this architecture document.
*   **Goals:** What are the primary technical and functional goals this architecture aims to achieve? (e.g., scalability, modularity, specific performance targets, security requirements).
*   **Non-Goals:** What is explicitly out of scope for this system/subsystem or this specific design?

## 2. High-Level Overview

[Provide a conceptual overview of the system/subsystem. A simple block diagram (Mermaid `graph TD` or `graph LR`) can be very effective here to show the main parts and their general relationships.]

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Component A] --> B(Component B);
    A --> C{Decision Point};
    C -- Yes --> D[Process 1];
    C -- No --> E[Process 2];
    B --> F((External System));
    D --> G[/Output Data/];
    E --> G;
```

*   **Key Principles:** Are there any overarching design principles followed (e.g., event-driven, microservices, layered architecture, domain-driven design)?

## 3. Component Breakdown

[Detail the major components identified in the overview. For each component:]

*   **`ComponentName`:**
    *   **Responsibility:** What is the single primary responsibility of this component?
    *   **Interfaces:** What are its key public interfaces (APIs, message queues it listens to/publishes on, classes/functions)?
    *   **Dependencies:** What other components or external systems does it rely on?
    *   **(Optional) Key Logic:** Briefly describe any particularly important internal logic or algorithms.

## 4. Data Models & Storage

*   **Key Data Structures:** Describe the main data entities or models used within the system/subsystem. Pydantic models or similar definitions are preferred.
    ```python
    # Example Pydantic Model
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from typing import List

    class UserData(BaseModel):
        user_id: str
        email: str
        preferences: List[str] = []
    ```
*   **Data Storage:** Where and how is persistent data stored (e.g., PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, file system, NoSQL DB)? Briefly describe the schema or storage strategy if relevant.
*   **Data Flow:** How does data move between components and storage? (A Mermaid sequence or flow diagram can be useful here).

## 5. Interaction Patterns & Communication

*   **Communication Style:** How do components communicate (e.g., synchronous API calls, asynchronous messaging via Mycelium, shared database)?
*   **Key Interaction Flows:** Describe 2-3 critical interaction sequences between components. Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`s are highly recommended.

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User
        participant ServiceA
        participant ServiceB
        participant Database

        User->>ServiceA: Request Action(Data)
        ServiceA->>ServiceB: Process Subtask(Data)
        ServiceB->>Database: Read/Write Data
        Database-->>ServiceB: Data/Confirmation
        ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Subtask Result
        ServiceA->>Database: Log Action
        ServiceA-->>User: Final Response
    ```
*   **API Contracts:** Reference the relevant API documentation (e.g., `subsystems/SUBSYSTEM/docs/API.md` or OpenAPI specifications).

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication/Authorization:** How is access controlled?
*   **Data Security:** How is data protected (encryption at rest/transit, input validation, output sanitization)? Reference ETHIK integration.
*   **Secrets Management:** How are API keys, passwords, etc., handled?
*   **Threat Model (Optional):** Briefly outline potential threats and mitigations.

## 7. Deployment & Scalability (Optional)

*   **Deployment Strategy:** How is this system/subsystem deployed (e.g., Docker containers, serverless functions)?
*   **Scalability:** How is the system designed to handle increased load?

## 8. Design Decisions & Alternatives Considered (Optional)

*   **Key Decisions:** Document significant design choices made.
*   **Alternatives:** Briefly mention alternative approaches considered and why they were not chosen.

## 9. Open Questions & Future Considerations

*   List any unresolved design questions.
*   Mention potential future enhancements or refactoring ideas.
