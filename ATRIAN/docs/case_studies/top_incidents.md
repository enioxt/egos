These case studies illustrate how ATRiAN-powered governance could have predicted, detected, or mitigated critical failures across sectors. They serve as reusable patterns for simulation scenarios, KPI monitors, and ROI assumptions.

| ID | Title | Year | Sector | Severity | Core Failure | ATRiAN Early-Warning Signals | Preventive Controls |
|----|-------|------|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| 4 | Uber AV killed pedestrian in Arizona | 2018 | Mobility | Fatality (3) | Mis-classified object; safety driver distraction | Perception confusion-matrix deficit on "jaywalking at night"; sim logs → high brake latency; missing redundancy flag | Night-pedestrian CI tests; dual-sensor fusion; driver-alert monitoring |
| 12 | Robot kills worker at Volkswagen plant | 2015 | Manufacturing | Fatality (3) | Safety cage disabled; motion planner assumed empty cell | Config diff disabling lockouts; risk-matrix anomaly (human in restricted zone) | Dual-check override workflow; proximity sensors |
| 23 | Las Vegas autonomous shuttle bus accident | 2017 | Mobility | Injury risk (2) | Shuttle stopped but no reverse; edge-case truck manoeuvre | Simulation scenario "others violate right-of-way" uncovered no evasive path; KPI "evasion available" alarm | Add reverse capability; V2X messaging tests |
| 1 | YouTube Kids shows inappropriate content | 2017 | Media | Child harm (2) | Recommender surfaced violent/sexual videos to kids | Real-time toxicity classifier exceeded threshold; CTR spike on flagged content | Stricter policy tests; adversarial prompt generation; human escalation |
| 54 | PredPol predictive-policing bias | 2016 | Public Safety | Systemic discrimination (2) | Feedback loop targeting minorities | Fairness KPI regression; counterfactual disparity eval | Data re-weighting; socio-economic covariates; governance board review |

## Usage in Workflows

1. **Simulation Library** – Each incident is encoded as a scenario template in the safety-simulation engine.
2. **Severity-Aware ROI** – `severity_score` informs `risk_mitigation_perc` scaling in ROI Monte-Carlo runs.
3. **Prompt Distillation** – Use `/distill_and_vault_prompt` on these diagnostics to create reusable prompts for automated reviews.

## Sector-Specific Pattern Recognition

These case studies demonstrate recurring patterns across different sectors:

### Mobility Sector
- **Pattern**: Perception failures in edge cases
- **Signal**: Confusion matrix gaps in rare object classes
- **Control**: Targeted test suite for vulnerable populations

### Manufacturing Sector
- **Pattern**: Safety overrides without compensating controls
- **Signal**: Configuration drift from safety baseline
- **Control**: Multi-factor authentication for safety settings

### Media & Content Sector
- **Pattern**: Recommender amplification of harmful content
- **Signal**: Toxicity spikes in user engagement metrics 
- **Control**: Safe exploration algorithms with bounded harm potential

### Public Safety Sector
- **Pattern**: Feedback loops reinforcing bias
- **Signal**: Disparate impact metrics across demographic groups
- **Control**: Counterfactual analysis and routine fairness audits

## Integration with ATRiAN Framework

Each case study informs multiple components of the ATRiAN ethical governance framework:

1. **Detection Modules**: Pattern-specific signal detectors implemented in `ATRIAN/detection/`
2. **Simulation Scenarios**: Edge-case tests derived from incidents in `ATRIAN/simulation/scenarios/`
3. **Control Library**: Preventive measures available in `ATRIAN/controls/`
4. **ROI Models**: Severity-based risk mitigation parameters in `data/roi/models/`
