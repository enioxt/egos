# EGOS Project Handover Summary

**Date of Summary:** May 12, 2025

## 1. Project Overview & Core Mission

EGOS (Evolving Generative Operating System) is a project aimed at creating a modular, AI-assisted development environment and a self-documenting, self-organizing codebase. The core mission revolves around principles of **Conscious Modularity**, **Universal Accessibility**, **Integrated Ethics**, and **Evolutionary Preservation**.

The project leverages AI (Cascade) for code generation, documentation, and system organization, with a strong emphasis on human-AI collaboration guided by the **Master Quantum Prompt (MQP)**.

## 2. Current System State & Key Subsystems

As of this date, the EGOS project comprises several key subsystems, each with specific roles. The documentation for these subsystems is primarily located in `docs/subsystems/`. Key subsystems include:

*   **AETHER:** Event-driven architecture, message bus.
*   **ATLAS:** Systemic cartography, visualization, and diagram generation.
*   **CHRONOS:** Temporal data management, scheduling (conceptual).
*   **CORE:** Shared functionalities, utilities, and core services.
*   **CORUJA:** Communication, notifications, and user feedback.
*   **ETHIK:** Ethical framework, input validation, and safety protocols.
*   **HARMONY:** Cross-platform compatibility and OS abstraction layer.
*   **KAIROS:** Performance monitoring and optimization.
*   **KOIOS:** Documentation management, indexing, and knowledge base.
*   **LYRA:** User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) framework.
*   **MYCELIUM:** Distributed knowledge graph, data persistence, and semantic search.
*   **NEXUS:** API gateway, external integrations, and service discovery.
*   **ORION:** Orchestration, workflow management, and task automation.
*   **PROMETHEUS:** Logging, monitoring, and system diagnostics.
*   **SEGURO:** Security, access control, and threat mitigation.
*   **SOMA:** Resource management and optimization.
*   **TEST:** Integrated testing framework and quality assurance.
*   **ZENITH:** Deployment, release management, and infrastructure automation.

Each subsystem aims for high cohesion and low coupling, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

## 3. File Structure & Organization Highlights

*   **Root Directory (`C:\EGOS\`):** Contains main project files (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LICENSE`), core scripts (`scripts/`), application code (`apps/`), and the main documentation directory (`docs/`).
*   **`docs/` Directory:** Intended as the central hub for all project documentation. Current reorganization efforts are underway to streamline this directory (Ref: `diagnosticoENIO.md`, `DOCS_DIRECTORY_DIAGNOSTIC_*.md`).
*   **`apps/` Directory:** Houses distinct applications built on the EGOS framework (e.g., `website`, `dashboard`).
*   **`scripts/` Directory:** Contains utility scripts, automation tools, and CLI interfaces for various project tasks.
*   **`config/` Directory:** Stores configuration files for different subsystems and tools.
*   **`archive/` Directory:** Central location for archived documents, old logs, and deprecated materials.
*   **`logs/` Directory:** Central location for current operational logs.

## 4. Development Workflow & Tools

*   **Version Control:** Git, hosted on GitHub (presumably).
*   **Branching Strategy:** Likely follows a standard model (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow) â€“ *specifics to be confirmed from `CONTRIBUTING.md` or version control standards.*
*   **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues (presumably).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code is commonly used.
*   **AI Assistant:** Cascade (Windsurf).
*   **Linting/Formatting:** Ruff for Python code.
*   **Task Management:** `ROADMAP.md` at project and subsystem levels; `CURRENT_TASKS.md` for specific components.

## 5. Key Standards and Processes (References to Documentation)

Several standards and processes govern development within EGOS. These are typically documented in `docs/standards/` and `docs/process/` (or `docs/governance/` post-reorganization).

*   **Conventional Commits:** All Git commit messages must adhere to the specification for Git commit messages.
*   **PEP 8 & Ruff:** Follow Python style guidelines; use Ruff for linting/formatting.
*   **Conscious Modularity:** Keep components focused and independent.
*   **SDRE / SEGURO / MWCP:** Follow established protocols for redundancy checks, directory navigation, and multi-window coordination.
*   **KOIOS Documentation Standards:** Maintain documentation quality and structure.
*   **ETHIK Principles:** Apply ethical considerations in development.

## 8. Current Roadmap Focus

The current major focus areas according to `ROADMAP.md` include:

*   **Project Structure & Documentation Overhaul:**
    *   Finalizing cross-reference guidelines.
    *   Developing tools for global indexing, metadata validation, and template generation.
    *   Executing the physical file migration based on the refined plan.
*   **Subsystem Enhancements:** Specific tasks outlined for TEST, MYCELIUM, CORUJA, KOIOS, etc. (See `ROADMAP.md` for details).
*   **Tooling and Automation:** Continued development of CLI tools and validation scripts.
