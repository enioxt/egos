# EGOS System Architecture

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-02

## Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the EVA & GUARANI Operating System (EGOS), including the interaction between core components and subsystems.

## Core Components

- **BIOS-Q:** Handles system bootstrap, core initialization, context management, and potentially some central coordination functions previously associated with MASTER.
- **Subsystems:** Specialized modules handling specific functionalities (ATLAS, CRONOS, ETHIK, HARMONY, KOIOS, NEXUS, TRANSLATOR).
- **Mycelial Network (Under Development):** The communication backbone intended to connect all subsystems.
- **KOIOS:** Manages system knowledge, standards, and documentation.

## Distribution of MASTER Functionality

*(Placeholder: This section needs to be detailed based on analysis of BIOS-Q, KOIOS, and potentially `src/` or `tools/` to explain how central coordination, task orchestration, and overall system state management are handled in the absence of a dedicated `subsystems/MASTER` directory.)*

## Subsystem Interaction Model

*(Placeholder: Describe the primary interaction patterns, e.g., via Mycelial Network, direct API calls, shared state, etc.)*

## Data Flow

*(Placeholder: High-level overview of how data moves through the system.)*

## Key Design Decisions

*(Placeholder: Document significant architectural choices and their rationale.)*

### Subsystem Overview

- **CRONOS:** Handles evolutionary preservation, state management, backups, and context continuity. (Absorbs functions previously conceptualized for BIOS-Q).

## Coordination & State Management

*(Placeholder: This section needs detailing based on analysis of KOIOS, CRONOS, and potentially Mycelium interactions to explain how central coordination, task orchestration, and overall system state management are handled).* Core system bootstrap and initialization are managed through environment setup (`.cursor/cursor_initialization.md`, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) and CRONOS state management.
