# Doc Organizer Enhancements and Roadmap Update

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** High  
**Roadmap IDs:** DOC-ORG-00, DOC-ORG-01, DOC-ORG-02, DOC-ORG-03, DOC-ORG-04, PROC-HANDOVER-01

## 1. Objective

To document the recent enhancements made to the `doc_organizer.py` script, update the project `ROADMAP.md` with new tasks related to `doc_organizer.py` and process standardization, and prepare for further development and handover.

## 2. Context

Following a session focused on improving `doc_organizer.py` (including error handling and planning for duplicate folder detection, file consolidation, and contextual analysis), and a request to formalize project documentation and processes.

## 3. Completed Tasks

### 3.1 `doc_organizer.py` Enhancements (Previous Session)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling throughout the script (e.g., `PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `OSError`).
- ✅ Added structured error reporting with detailed information.
- ✅ Implemented a retry mechanism for transient errors during directory deletion.
- ✅ Improved initialization validation in the `DocOrganizer` class.
- ✅ Added logic for file consolidation based on importance and creation date (initial implementation).

### 3.2 `ROADMAP.md` Update (Current Session)
- ✅ Added new section "Document Organization and Cleanup (`doc_organizer.py`)" with detailed tasks:
    - DOC-ORG-00: Foundational script (error handling, performance, ignore patterns, age-based deletion).
    - DOC-ORG-01: Duplicate Folder Detection.
    - DOC-ORG-02: File Consolidation from Duplicates.
    - DOC-ORG-03: Contextual File Analysis.
    - DOC-ORG-04: Actionable Suggestions (merge, archive, delete).
- ✅ Added new section "Project Management & Process Standards" with task:
    - PROC-HANDOVER-01: Define and document a robust Handover Process.
- ✅ Corrected formatting issues in `ROADMAP.md` after initial update.

## 4. Next Steps

- [ ] Update `README.md` for `doc_organizer.py` to reflect recent changes and planned features.
- [ ] Create/Update project-level `README.md` to summarize `doc_organizer.py` and link to its specific README.
- [ ] Define and document the Handover Process standard in `docs/standards/handover_process.md`.
- [ ] Implement planned features for `doc_organizer.py`:
    - [ ] **DOC-ORG-01**: Duplicate Folder Detection.
    - [ ] **DOC-ORG-02**: File Consolidation from Duplicates (refine existing).
    - [ ] **DOC-ORG-03**: Contextual File Analysis.
    - [ ] **DOC-ORG-04**: Actionable Suggestions.
- [ ] **DOC-ORG-00-ERR-TEST-01**: Test `doc_organizer.py` with various error scenarios.
- [ ] **DOC-ORG-00-PERF-01**: Implement performance improvements for `doc_organizer.py`.
